Swimming is also an excellent form of exercise as it works out all the major muscle groups. Moreover, if done regularly, swimming can help improve flexibility, coordination, and cardiovascular health.

## Physical Health Benefits

When you swim, you use your entire body to propel yourself through the water, making it a great exercise for building strength. Swimming regularly can help tone your muscles, burn calories, and promote weight loss. It's also an excellent cardiovascular workout and can help improve lung capacity and respiratory strength.
