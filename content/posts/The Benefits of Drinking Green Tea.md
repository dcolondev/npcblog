# The Benefits of Drinking Green Tea

Drinking green tea has been popularized throughout Asia for centuries, but it has only recently gained attention in Western cultures.  Green tea is made from Camellia sinensis leaves and does not undergo the same withering and oxidation process as black or oolong teas. 

## Health Benefits 

Green tea is an excellent source of antioxidants, which help reduce inflammation and prevent cell damage. Studies suggest that regular consumption of green tea may help lower the risk of developing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Green tea also contains L-theanine, an amino acid that can promote relaxation without causing drowsiness. 

## Weight Management 

Green tea may also play a role in weight management. It contains caffeine, which can increase metabolism and aid in fat burning. One study found that green tea consumption led to a decrease in body fat percentage, body weight, and waist circumference. 

## How to Brew Green Tea 

To make a cup of green tea, bring water to about 175Â°F, and steep one teaspoon of loose green tea leaves or one teabag for three to four minutes. Do not use boiling water as it can make the tea taste bitter. Green tea can be enjoyed hot or cold and can be sweetened with honey or sugar.
