# The Benefits of Drinking Green Tea

Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves and buds. It originated in China and is now consumed by people all over the world. Green tea is known for its numerous health benefits. In this article, we will discuss some of the most important benefits of drinking green tea.

## Boosts Metabolism and Burns Fat

Green tea contains caffeine and a type of flavonoid called catechin, both of which are known to boost metabolism and fat burning. Studies have shown that green tea can increase fat burning by up to 17% and boost metabolism by up to 4%.

## Lowers Risk of Cardiovascular Disease

Drinking green tea regularly has been shown to lower the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by up to 31%. The catechins in green tea help to reduce inflammation and prevent the formation of blood clots, which are two major factors contributing to cardiovascular disease.

## Reduces Risk of Cancer

Green tea has been shown to reduce the risk of developing several types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. The antioxidants in green tea help to protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, which can lead to cancer.
