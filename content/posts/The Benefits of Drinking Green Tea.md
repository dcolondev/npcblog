Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves and buds that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process used to make oolong and black teas. It has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its many health benefits.

## Health Benefits of Green Tea

Studies have shown that green tea can help with weight loss, improve brain function, and reduce the risk of certain types of cancer. It contains powerful antioxidants called catechins, which help protect the body from damage caused by free radicals.
