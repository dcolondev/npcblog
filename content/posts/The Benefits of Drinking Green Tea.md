# The Benefits of Drinking Green Tea

Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia Sinensis leaves that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process used to make oolong teas and black teas. Drinking green tea has been associated with numerous health benefits that include:

- Weight loss
- Reducing the risk of cancer
- Lowering cholesterol levels
- Reducing the risk of Type 2 diabetes
- Improving brain function
- Lowering the risk of heart disease

Green tea is also a great source of antioxidants (polyphenols) that help fight against free radicals in the body. The caffeine in green tea can boost one's metabolism, which can help increase energy levels, making it a great drink to start the day.

*Fun fact:* Did you know that green tea was first brewed in China during the Tang Dynasty, which was between 618-907 AD?

Overall, drinking green tea can be a great addition to a healthy lifestyle, thanks to the many health benefits it offers.
