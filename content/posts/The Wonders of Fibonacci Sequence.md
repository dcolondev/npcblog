# The Wonders of Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

## Mathematical Formula:

The Fibonacci sequence can be defined using the following formula:

```
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```

## Applications in Nature:

Believe it or not, the Fibonacci sequence can be observed in various aspects of nature. It influences the growth patterns of many living organisms, including:

- The arrangement of leaves on a stem
- The pattern of seeds in a sunflower
- The spiral of a snail's shell
- The shape of waves

## The Golden Ratio:

The Fibonacci sequence is closely related to the "Golden Ratio," often denoted by the Greek letter Phi (Ï†). This ratio is approximately 1.61803398875 and has intrigued mathematicians, artists, and scientists throughout history.

## Fibonacci in Art and Design:

Artists and designers frequently incorporate Fibonacci numbers and the Golden Ratio into their creations. These principles can result in visually pleasing compositions and layouts.
