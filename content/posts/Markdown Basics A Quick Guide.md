# Markdown Basics: A Quick Guide

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to be easy-to-read and easy-to-write. It allows you to format text documents without the need for complex coding. Markdown is widely used for creating basic websites, documentation, and in various blogging platforms.

## Why Markdown?
- **Simplicity**: Markdown has a simple syntax that is intuitive and easy to learn.
- **Portability**: Markdown files are plain text, so they can be opened and edited with any text editor.
- **Readability**: Markdown files are highly readable even in plain text form, making it easier to collaborate and review.

## Common Markdown Syntax

### Headers
To create headers, prefix the text with hash symbols (#). The number of hash symbols indicates the level of the header.

Example:
```
# This is a level-one heading
## This is a level-two heading
### This is a level-three heading
```

### Formatting Text
- **Bold**: Surround text with double asterisks or double underscores: `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`.
- _Italic_: Surround text with single asterisks or single underscores: `*italic text*` or `_italic text_`.
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Surround text with double tildes: `~~strikethrough text~~`.

### Lists
- **Ordered List**:
```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

- **Unordered List**:
```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

### Links and Images
- **Link**: `[Link Text](https://example.com)`
- **Image**: `![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)`

### Blockquotes
> To create a blockquote, use the greater-than symbol (`>`).

### Code Blocks
- **Inline code**: Wrap inline code with backticks: \`code\`.
- **Code block**: Indent four spaces or use triple backticks:
```javascript
function example() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```
