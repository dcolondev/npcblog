# Markdown Formatting

In this document, we will explore the various formatting options available in Markdown.

## Headers

Headers are indicated by using one or more `#` symbols at the beginning of a line. The number of `#` symbols determines the level of the header. For example:

### This is a Level 3 Header
#### This is a Level 4 Header
##### This is a Level 5 Header

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Unordered lists can be created by using either asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens. For example:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered lists are created by using numbers followed by periods. For example:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Emphasis

To emphasize text in Markdown, you can use either asterisks or underscores. For example:

- *Italic text*
- **Bold text**
- ***Bold and italic text***

## Links

Creating links in Markdown is simple. Just surround the link text with square brackets and put the URL in parentheses. For example:

## Images

You can also include images in Markdown by using an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for alt text, and parentheses for the image URL. For example:

![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png)

## Code Blocks

Code blocks can be created by indenting the text with four spaces or by using triple backticks. For example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are created by using the greater than symbol (`>`). For example:

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write plain text and convert it to HTML.
