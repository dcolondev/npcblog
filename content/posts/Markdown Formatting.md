# Markdown Formatting

Welcome to this markdown formatted document! In this document, we will explore some of the interesting ways you can format your text using markdown syntax. So, let's get started!

## Headers

Headers are a great way to organize your document and give it a clear structure. You can create headers by using hash ( # ) symbols before your text. The number of hash symbols will determine the level of the header.

### Example

```
# Main Header

## Sub Header

### Sub-Sub Header
```

## Lists

Lists are commonly used to present information in an organized manner. Markdown supports both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullet point) lists.

### Example

#### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

#### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Links and Images

Markdown allows you to add hyperlinks and images to your document. You can create a link by enclosing the link text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses. To add an image, you can use similar syntax, but with an exclamation mark before the square brackets.

### Example

```

```

## Emphasis

Markdown also provides options to emphasize your text. You can make text *italic* by enclosing it in single asterisks or underscores, and **bold** by enclosing it in double asterisks or underscores.

### Example

```
*Italic Text*
_Italic Text_

**Bold Text**
__Bold Text__
```

## Blockquotes

If you want to highlight a quote or a citation, you can use blockquotes. Simply prefix the quoted text with a greater than sign ( > ).

### Example

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs

## Code Blocks

When you need to display code or commands, use code blocks. You can create a code block by enclosing the code within triple backticks.

### Example

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Conclusion

In this document, we explored various markdown formatting options, such as headers, lists, links, images, emphasis, blockquotes, and code blocks. With these tools in your arsenal, you can create visually appealing and well-organized documents using simple and intuitive syntax.
