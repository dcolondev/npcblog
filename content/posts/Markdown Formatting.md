# Markdown Formatting

In this document, we will explore the various formatting options available in **Markdown**. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create structured documents with ease. Whether you want to create headers, lists, code snippets, or even add images, Markdown has got you covered.

## Headers

In Markdown, headers are created using hashtags. The number of hashtags denotes the level of the header.

# H1 Header
## H2 Header
### H3 Header

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

Unordered List:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered List:
1. First Item
2. Second Item
3. Third Item

## Code Snippets

You can include code snippets by surrounding your code with backticks.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Links

Adding links in Markdown is quite straightforward. Here's an example of an inline link: [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

## Images

To include images, use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets containing the alt text and parentheses containing the image URL.

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are a great way to emphasize quotes or highlight important sections.
