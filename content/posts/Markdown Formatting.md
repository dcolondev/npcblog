# Markdown Formatting

Here are some tips to help you format your documents using Markdown.

## Headers

You can create headers using the '#' symbol. The number of '#'s determines the level of the header: 

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4

## Emphasis

You can make text *italic* by surrounding it with a single asterisk or underscore. For **bold** text, use double asterisks or underscores. ***Bold and italic*** text is created by using triple asterisks or underscores.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. For unordered lists, you can use a dash, asterisk, or plus sign:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

For ordered lists, use numbers:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links

To create a link, use brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL:

## Images

To embed an image, use similar syntax to links, but with an exclamation mark in front:

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are useful for highlighting quotes or citations:

## Code

It is important to format code properly. Inline code can be created with backticks: `print("Hello, Markdown!")`. For code blocks, use triple backticks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
```

## Tables

| Name  | Age |
|-------|-----|
| Alice | 25  |
| Bob   | 30  |
| Carol | 35  |

## Horizontal Rule

You can insert a horizontal rule using three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:
