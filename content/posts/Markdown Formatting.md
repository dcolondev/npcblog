# Markdown Formatting

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write structured documents with ease. It is widely used for creating documentation, writing blog posts, and even generating web pages.

## Basic Formatting

You can use various markdown tags to apply basic formatting to your text:

- *Italic*: Use single asterisks or underscores around the text, like `*italic*` or `_italic_`.
- **Bold**: Use double asterisks or underscores, like `**bold**` or `__bold__`.
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Use double tildes, like `~~strikethrough~~`.
- `Code`: Use backticks, like \`code\`.

## Headings

Headings help in organizing your document and creating a visual hierarchy. You can use up to six levels of headings:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Lists

Lists help in presenting information in a structured manner. There are two types of lists:

1. **Ordered Lists**

   Use numbers followed by a period to create ordered lists:
   
   1. First item
   2. Second item
   3. Third item
   
2. **Unordered Lists**

   Use hyphens, plus signs, or asterisks to create unordered lists:
   
   - First item
   - Second item
   - Third item

## Links and Images

You can easily add links and images to your markdown document:
