# Markdown Formatting

This document showcases the various formatting options available in markdown.

## Headings

Markdown supports six levels of headings, denoted by "#" symbols. Here's an example:

### Level 3 Heading

## Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists using markdown.

### Unordered List
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Emphasis

Emphasize text using asterisks (*) or underscores (_).

*Italic* text can be achieved with single asterisks or underscores.

**Bold** text can be achieved with double asterisks or underscores.

## Links

You can create inline links or reference links in markdown.

## Images

Markdown allows you to add images using the following syntax:

![Alt Text](image.jpg)

## Code

Inline code can be created by wrapping text within a backtick (`).

For blocks of code, use triple backticks (```).

## Blockquotes

You can create blockquotes in markdown by using the ">" symbol.

> This is a blockquote.

## Horizontal Rule

A horizontal rule can be created using three hyphens (---) or three asterisks (***).
