# Markdown Formatting

---

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to style your text using simple and easy-to-read syntax. It has become increasingly popular among writers and developers for its simplicity and versatility. In this document, we will explore some of the key features and formatting options available in Markdown.

## Basic Formatting

### Headers

You can create headers in Markdown by using "#" symbols at the beginning of a line. The number of "#" symbols determines the level of the header, with one "#" representing the largest header and six "#" symbols representing the smallest header. For example:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

### Emphasis

Markdown allows you to emphasize text using asterisks (*) or underscores (_). You can use a single (*) or (_) for italics and a double (**) or (__) for bold. For example:

*This text is in italics.*
_This text is also in italics._

**This text is in bold.**
__This text is also in bold.__

### Lists

You can create both ordered and unordered lists in Markdown. For unordered lists, simply use asterisks (*), hyphens (-), or plus signs (+) at the beginning of each line. For ordered lists, use numbers followed by periods. For example:

Unordered list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered list:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Advanced Formatting

### Links

You can create links in Markdown using the following format:

[Link Text](https://www.example.com)

For example, [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) is a great resource for learning more about Markdown syntax.

### Images

You can also embed images in your Markdown document using the following format:

![Alt Text](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)

Here is an example of an embedded image:

![Markdown Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)

### Code Blocks

To display code or snippets in your document, you can use code blocks. Code blocks can be created by indenting the lines of code by four spaces or by using triple backticks (```). For example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

### Tables

Markdown also supports the creation of tables. You can create tables by using vertical bars (|) and hyphens (-) to define the headers and content of the table. For example:

| Column 1     | Column 2     |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Content 1    | Content 2    |
| More content | More content |
