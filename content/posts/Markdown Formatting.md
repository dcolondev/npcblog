# Markdown Formatting

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write documents using plain text formatting, which is then converted into valid HTML. It provides a simple and easy-to-read syntax for creating consistent and visually appealing documents.

## Heading 2

Markdown supports various formatting options, such as **bold** or *italic* text. You can also create [links](https://www.example.com) or display images:

2. Second item
3. Third item

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

Markdown also allows you to format code snippets inline, like `console.log('Hello, markdown!');`, or in code blocks:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
