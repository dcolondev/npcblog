# Markdown Formatting

Hey there! In this document, I'll show you how to format your text using Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to style your text using simple and intuitive syntax.

## Headers

You can create headers by using hash (#) symbols. The number of hash symbols determines the level of the header. For example:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text using asterisks (*) or underscores (_). Here are some examples:

Italic: *italic text* or _italic text_

Bold: **bold text** or __bold text__

## Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists. For unordered lists, use asterisks (*) or dashes (-). For example:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

For ordered lists, use numbers. For example:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links

You can create links by using square brackets [] and parentheses (). Here's an example:

[Markdown Guide](https://www.example.com)

## Images

You can add images using an exclamation mark (!), followed by square brackets [] for alt text and parentheses () for the image URL. For example:

![Markdown Logo](https://www.example.com/markdown-logo.png)

## Blockquotes

You can add blockquotes by using a greater-than (>) symbol. For example:

> This is a blockquote.

## Code

You can display inline code by wrapping it with backticks (`). For example, `print("Hello, world!")`.

For displaying code blocks, you can use triple backticks (```) with the specified language after the opening backticks. For example:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Horizontal Rule

You can create a horizontal rule using three asterisks (***) or hyphens (---).

***

That's it! With these Markdown tags, you can create well-formatted documents easily.
