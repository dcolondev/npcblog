# Markdown Formatting

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write text using a simple syntax. It is widely used for formatting documentation, blogs, and README files on various platforms. In this document, we will explore some of the key features and tags available in markdown.

## Headings

Markdown supports six levels of headings, denoted by hash symbols (#) at the beginning of a line. The number of hash symbols indicates the level of the heading, where one hash symbol represents the highest level (h1) and six hash symbols represent the lowest level (h6).

### Formatting Text

Markdown allows you to apply formatting to text in various ways. Here are some examples:

- *Italic text* can be achieved by wrapping the text with single asterisks (*) or underscores (_).
- **Bold text** can be achieved by wrapping the text with double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__).
- ***Bold and italic text*** can be achieved by combining the above formats.
- ~~Strikethrough text~~ can be achieved by wrapping the text with double tildes (~~).

### Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Unordered lists can be created by using dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) at the beginning of each line. Ordered lists can be created by using numbers followed by periods.

Here is an example of an unordered list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And here is an example of an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Links and Images

Creating links and embedding images in markdown is straightforward. Links are created by using square brackets ([]), followed by the URL in round brackets (()).

For example, here is a link to [GitHub](https://github.com).

Images can be embedded by using an exclamation mark (!) followed by square brackets ([]) containing the alt text, and the URL in round brackets (()).

### Blockquotes

Markdown allows you to create blockquotes by using the greater than symbol (>) at the beginning of a line. This is useful for quoting text or adding emphasis to specific content.
