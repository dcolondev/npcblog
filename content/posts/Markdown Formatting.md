# Markdown Formatting

---

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore various markdown formatting options to make our text visually appealing. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to easily format text without the need for complex HTML tags.

---

## Headers

In markdown, you can create headers by using hash (`#`) symbols. The number of hash symbols denotes the level of the header. For example:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

---

## Text Formatting

You can format text in markdown in several ways:

- **Bold**: Surround the text with double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`). For example, **bold text**.

- *Italic*: Surround the text with single asterisks (`*`) or single underscores (`_`). For example, *italic text*.

- ~~Strikethrough~~: Surround the text with double tildes (`~~`). For example, ~~strikethrough text~~.

---

## Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists in markdown:

Unordered List:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered List:
1. First Item
2. Second Item
3. Third Item

```
