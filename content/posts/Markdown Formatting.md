# Markdown Formatting

---

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore the various markdown formatting options that can be used to enhance the visual appeal of text. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows users to format plain text documents with ease.

## Formatting Options

### Headers

Headers are created by adding one or more hashtag symbols (#) at the beginning of a line. The number of hashtags determines the level of the header, with one hashtag representing the highest level and six hashtags representing the lowest level.

Example:

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

### Emphasis

Text can be emphasized using various options:

- *Italic*: Surround the text with single asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`).
- **Bold**: Surround the text with double asterisks (`**`) or underscores (`__`).
- ***Bold and Italic***: Surround the text with triple asterisks (`***`) or underscores (`___`).

Example:

```
*Italic text*
**Bold text**
***Bold and Italic text***
```

### Lists

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullet-point) lists. To create a list, use a hyphen (`-`) or an asterisk (`*`) to start each item in an unordered list, or use a number followed by a period (`1.`) for an ordered list.

Example:

```
Unordered List:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered List:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

### Links

Links can be added by enclosing the link text in square brackets (`[]`) and the URL in parentheses (`()`).

Example:

```
[Google](https://www.google.com)
```

### Images

To add images, use an exclamation mark (`!`), followed by alternate text in square brackets (`[]`), and the URL or file path in parentheses (`()`).

Example:

```
![Alternate Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```
