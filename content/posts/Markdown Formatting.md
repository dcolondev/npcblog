# Markdown Formatting

In this document, we will explore the power of Markdown formatting. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to style and structure text on the web.

## Headings

One of the most common formatting elements in Markdown is headings. Headings help to organize your content and provide structure to your document. Markdown offers six levels of headings, from `# Heading 1` to `###### Heading 6`, with `# Heading 1` being the largest and `###### Heading 6` the smallest.

## Lists

Lists are another useful feature of Markdown. Unordered lists can be created using a hyphen `-` or an asterisk `*`, while ordered lists are created using numbers.

Here is an example of an unordered list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And here is an example of an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Emphasis

Markdown offers several ways to emphasize text. You can use asterisks `*` or underscores `_` to wrap text in italics, and double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` to wrap text in bold.

For example, this is *italic text* and this is **bold text**.

## Links

Links are an essential component of web documents. Markdown makes it easy to create links by using square brackets `[]` to enclose the link text and parentheses `()` to enclose the URL.

Here is an example of a link: [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

## Images

Markdown also allows you to embed images in your documents. Similar to creating links, you can use an exclamation mark `!` followed by square brackets `[]` to add alt text and parentheses `()` to include the image URL.

## Code Blocks

When writing technical or programming-related content, code blocks come in handy. Markdown offers a simple way to display code. You can use backticks \` to wrap inline code snippets or triple backticks \`\`\` to create multiline code blocks.

Here is an example of inline code: `print("Hello, Markdown!")`

And here is a code block:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```
