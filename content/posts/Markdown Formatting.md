# Markdown Formatting

In this document, we will explore the various formatting options available in Markdown.

## Titles

Markdown allows for easy formatting of titles using the # symbol. The number of # symbols at the beginning of a line determines the title level.

### Subtitle

## Text Formatting

Markdown supports several ways to format text, such as **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~, and `code`.

## Lists

1. Ordered List Item
2. Ordered List Item
    * Unordered List Item
    * Unordered List Item

## Links and Images

Markdown also provides a simple syntax for creating links and embedding images. For example, you can create a link to [Google](https://www.google.com) or embed an image ![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png).

## Blockquotes

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext.

## Tables

Markdown supports creating tables with proper alignment and formatting. Here's an example:

| Name     | Age | Occupation |
|----------|-----|------------|
| John     | 35  | Engineer   |
| Sarah    | 28  | Doctor     |
| Michael  | 42  | Lawyer     |

## Code Blocks

You can highlight code snippets using code blocks. Here's an example in Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("John")
```

## Horizontal Rule

Dividers can be created using three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores.
