# Markdown Formatting

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore the different formatting options available in Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write plain text that can be easily converted to HTML. It is widely used for creating documents, blogs, and even websites.

## Basic Formatting

### Headings

You can create headings by using hashtag symbols. The number of hashtags indicates the level of the heading. For example:

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
```

### Emphasis

You can make text *italic* by surrounding it with asterisks or underscores (`*` or `_`). For bold text, use double asterisks or underscores (`**` or `__`). If you want to combine both emphasis styles, use triple asterisks or underscores (`***` or `___`).

### Links

Links are created using square brackets to contain the link text and parentheses to contain the URL or file path. For example:

```

```

### Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. To create an unordered list, use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens. For ordered lists, use numbers followed by periods.

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

## Advanced Formatting

### Code Blocks

To format code, surround it with backticks (\`). For code blocks with multiple lines, use three backticks (```). You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting.

Inline code: `print("Hello, World!")`

```
def hello():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
```

### Images

To add images, use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets containing an alt text and parentheses containing the image URL.

```

```

### Tables

Tables can be created using pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`). The first row represents the table header.

```
| Name     | Age | City      |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| John     | 25  | New York  |
| Jane     | 30  | London    |
```

## Conclusion

Markdown offers a simple and flexible way to format documents, making them visually appealing and easy to read. By using various tags provided in Markdown, you can create documents with different styles and elements.
