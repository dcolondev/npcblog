# Markdown Formatting

In this document, I will showcase the various markdown formatting options that can be used to create visually appealing documents.

## 1. Headers

Headers are essential for structuring your document. There are six levels of headers available in markdown, denoted by the number of hash marks (`#`).

### Example:

```
# First Level Header
## Second Level Header
### Third Level Header
#### Fourth Level Header
##### Fifth Level Header
###### Sixth Level Header
```

## 2. Emphasis

You can add emphasis to your text by using *italic*, **bold**, or ~~strikethrough~~.

### Example:

```
*Italic text*
**Bold text**
~~Strikethrough~~
```

## 3. Lists

Lists allow you to organize information in an ordered or unordered manner.

### Unordered List Example:

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

### Ordered List Example:

```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

## 4. Links and Images

Adding links and images is an important part of creating content.

### Link Example:

```
[Link Text](https://example.com)
```

### Image Example:

```
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

## 5. Code Blocks

Including code snippets can enhance your document's readability.

### Example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## 6. Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be used to highlight important information or quotes.

### Example:

```
> This is a blockquote.
```
