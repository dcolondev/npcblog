# Markdown Formatting

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for creating formatted documents. It is designed to be easy to read and write, while also being easily converted to HTML and other formats. In this document, we will explore various markdown tags and how they can be used to make your documents visually appealing.

## Headers

Headers are used to indicate different levels of importance or sections within a document. Markdown provides six levels of headers, denoted by one to six hash '#' symbols. Here's an example:

### This is a Level 3 Header

## Emphasis and Bold

You can add emphasis or bold text using asterisks (*), underscores (_), or double asterisks (**), double underscores (__). For example:

*This text will be italicized.*

**This text will be bold.**

## Lists

Lists are a common way to present information in an organized manner. Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Here's an example of an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

And here's an example of an unordered list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

## Links

Links can be created by enclosing the link text in square brackets followed by the URL in parentheses. For example:

[Markdown Guide](https://www.example.com/markdown-guide)

## Images

Images can be embedded in Markdown documents using a similar syntax as links. The only difference is that an exclamation mark (!) is placed before the square brackets. For example:

![Markdown Logo](https://www.example.com/images/markdown-logo.png)

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to highlight a section of text that has been quoted from elsewhere. They are denoted by a greater than symbol (>). For example:

> "The best way to predict the future is to create it." - Peter Drucker

## Code

Inline code can be formatted by enclosing it with backticks (\`). For example:

Use the `print()` function to display output.

Code blocks can be created by indenting each line with four spaces or a tab. Alternatively, you can enclose the code block in triple backticks (\`\`\`). For example:

```
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Tables

Markdown supports simple table creation. Here's an example:

| Item   | Quantity |
| ------ | -------- |
| Apple  | 5        |
| Banana | 3        |
| Orange | 2        |
