# Markdown Formatting

In this document, we will explore the various formatting options available in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text documents. Markdown is widely used for creating content on the web, writing README files, and even generating static websites.

## Headings

Headings in Markdown are created by using hash symbols. The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading. For example:

### Level 3 Heading

#### Level 4 Heading

## Styling Text

You can add emphasis to text in Markdown using asterisks or underscores. Here are a few examples:

*Italic text*

**Bold text**

***Bold and italic text***

## Lists

Unordered lists can be created using asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens. Here's an example:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered lists are created using numbers:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links and Images

Hyperlinks can be added in Markdown using square brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL:

[Click here](https://www.example.com) to visit our website.

You can insert images in Markdown using a similar syntax:

![Alt Text](path/to/image.jpg)

## Code Blocks

To add a code snippet in Markdown, surround the code with backticks:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

## Blockquotes

To add a blockquote, simply prefix the line with the `>` symbol:

> This is a blockquote. It can span multiple lines and is often used to highlight important information.

## Horizontal Rule

A horizontal rule can be added using three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:
