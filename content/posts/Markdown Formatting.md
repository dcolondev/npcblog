# Markdown Formatting

In this document, we will explore the various formatting options available in Markdown, a lightweight markup language.

## Headings

Headings are used to structure your document. There are six levels of headings in Markdown, denoted by the number of hash (#) characters preceding the text.

### Example:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Text Styling

Markdown allows you to style your text in different ways.

- **Bold**: To make text bold, surround it with double asterisks or double underscores.
- *Italic*: Use a single asterisk or single underscore to italicize text.
- ~~Strikethrough~~: To strikethrough text, use double tilde.

### Example:

**This text is bold.**

*This text is italicized.*

~~This text is strikethrough.~~

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

### Unordered List:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links and Images

Hyperlinks and images can be added to Markdown documents.

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes allow you to highlight quoted text.

### Example:

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

## Code

Inline code and code blocks can be included in Markdown documents.

### Inline Code:

Use backticks to highlight inline code: `print("Hello, World!")`

### Code Block:

```
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")

greet()
```
