# Markdown Formatting

Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for creating documents. It is widely used for its simplicity and compatibility with various platforms. Markdown allows users to focus on the content without worrying about complex formatting. The following guide will walk you through the basics of markdown formatting.

## Headings

Headings are used to structure your document. They provide hierarchy and help readers navigate through your content. Markdown supports six levels of headings, starting from h1 to h6. Different levels of headings can be created using the hash symbol.

### Example:

```
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6
```

## Text Formatting

Markdown offers various options for text formatting, including **bold**, *italic*, and ~~strikethrough~~. 

### Example:

```
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
~~Strikethrough text~~
```

## Lists

Lists are essential for organizing information. Markdown supports both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullet) lists.

### Unordered List Example:

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2.1
  - Item 2.2
- Item 3
```

### Ordered List Example:

```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

## Links

Adding links to your markdown document is straightforward. Just enclose the link text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses.

### Example:

```

```

## Images

To add images, use the same syntax as links but with an exclamation mark (!) at the beginning.

### Example:

```
![Alt Text](path/to/image.jpg)
```

## Code Blocks

Code blocks in markdown are ideal for displaying code snippets or terminal commands. Use triple backticks (```) followed by the language name to highlight syntax.

### Example:

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Quotes

You can include block quotes in markdown to highlight important information or cite sources.

### Example:

```
> Markdown is a versatile markup language for creating structured documents.
```
