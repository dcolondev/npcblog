# Markdown Formatting

This document showcases various markdown formatting options. Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text documents. It allows you to add structure, emphasis, links, images, and other elements to your text. Below, we explore some of the most commonly used markdown tags.

## Headings

Headings are used to structure your document into sections. They start with a hash symbol (#) followed by a space. The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading, with a single hash symbol (#) indicating the highest level.

### Subheadings

You can also include subheadings by using multiple hash symbols. Subheadings provide a hierarchy and make your document more readable.

## Emphasis

Emphasizing certain words or phrases is important to draw attention to them. Markdown offers different ways to emphasize text:

- *Italic*: Surround the text with asterisks (*) or underscores (_).
- **Bold**: Enclose the text with double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__).
- ***Bold and Italic***: Combine the two methods above.

## Lists

Lists help organize information. Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

1. Ordered list: Begin each line with a number, followed by a period and a space.
2. Continue with the next item.
   - Unordered sublist: Use a hyphen (-), plus symbol (+), or an asterisk (*) to denote subitems.

- Unordered list: Start each line with a hyphen, plus symbol, or an asterisk.
- You can nest lists by indenting the subitems.

## Links and Images

Markdown allows you to add hyperlinks and images to your document.

- [Link](https://example.com): Use square brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL.
- ![Image](https://example.com/image.jpg): Add an exclamation mark before square brackets and include the image URL in parentheses.

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to highlight quotes or excerpts from external sources. You can create a blockquote by prefixing the text with a greater than symbol (>).

## Code

Including code snippets is simple with markdown.

Inline code: Surround the code with backticks (`).

```python
# Code block
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
```

## Tables

Markdown allows you to create tables with multiple rows and columns.

| Name     | Age | Gender |
|----------|-----|--------|
| John     | 25  | Male   |
| Jane     | 30  | Female |
| Michael  | 35  | Male   |
