# Markdown Formatting

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write documents in plain text format, which can then be easily converted to HTML or other formats. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the goal of providing an easy-to-read and easy-to-write syntax for content creation.

## Features of Markdown

Markdown syntax offers a variety of tags to format your text. Here are some commonly used features:

### Headings

You can create headings using different levels. For example:

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Emphasis

To emphasize text, you can use asterisks or underscores:

```
*Italic text* or _Italic text_
**Bold text** or __Bold text__
```

### Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists:

Unordered List:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered List:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Links

Creating links is as simple as enclosing the link text in square brackets, followed by the URL in parentheses:

### Images

Similarly, you can insert images using a similar syntax:

![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)

### Code Blocks

To display code, you can use backticks:
```
const greeting = 'Hello, Markdown!';
console.log(greeting);
```

### Blockquotes

To add a blockquote, simply use the greater than symbol (>) before the text:

> This is a blockquote.
