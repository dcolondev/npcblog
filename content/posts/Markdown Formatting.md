# Markdown Formatting

## Introduction
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write plain text using simple syntax to create formatted documents. It is widely used for writing documentation, creating blog posts, and even writing books. In this document, we will explore various markdown tags and their usage to create visually appealing content.

## Heading Levels
You can use different heading levels to structure your document. This helps in organizing your content and creating a hierarchy.

### Subheading 1
Some text goes here...

### Subheading 2
Some text goes here...

## Styling Text
Markdown provides various ways to style your text. Here are some examples:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- ~~Strikethrough text~~

## Lists

## Blockquotes
If you want to highlight a quote, you can use blockquotes. They automatically add indentation and a different font style:

> This is a blockquote. It can be used to emphasize important information or cite external sources.

## Code Blocks
To include code snippets or highlight code within the text, you can use code blocks. Here is an example:

```
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Markdown"));
```

Markdown offers a simple and intuitive way to format your text. With various tags and syntax, you can create visually appealing documents without any hassle.
