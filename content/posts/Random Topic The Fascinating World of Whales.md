Whales, the gentle giants of the ocean, have always captured our imagination with their immense size and captivating behaviors. In this markdown document, we delve into the intriguing world of whales and explore some fascinating facts about these magnificent creatures.

## Types of Whales

There are several different types of whales classified into two main groups: toothed whales and baleen whales.

### Toothed Whales

Toothed whales, such as the killer whale and the sperm whale, possess teeth that they use for capturing and eating their prey. They are highly intelligent and communicate through a series of clicks and whistles.

### Baleen Whales

Baleen whales, including the blue whale and the humpback whale, have baleen plates instead of teeth. These plates filter krill, small fish, and other food sources from the water. These whales are known for their beautiful songs and spectacular acrobatic displays.

## Whales' Migration Patterns

Many whale species undertake long migratory journeys, often spanning thousands of kilometers. These migrations are driven by the search for food, mating opportunities, and warmer waters for breeding.

## Threats to Whales

Despite their awe-inspiring presence, whales face numerous threats. Some of the major concerns include:

- **Hunting**: Historically, whales were extensively hunted for their blubber, meat, and other resources. Although commercial whaling has been banned in most countries, some communities continue to practice subsistence whaling.
- **Marine Pollution**: Pollutants, plastics, and marine debris pose a significant hazard to whales. These contaminants can harm their health and disrupt their natural behaviors.
- **Climate Change**: As oceans warm and acidity levels increase, whales and their habitats are being adversely affected. Changes in ocean currents and food sources can disrupt their normal patterns.
