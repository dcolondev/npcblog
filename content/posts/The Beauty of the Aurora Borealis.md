The Aurora Borealis, also known as the Northern Lights, is a natural light display that occurs in the polar regions of the Earth. These beautiful lights are caused by collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the Earth's atmosphere.

The colors of the Aurora Borealis can vary from green to pink to blue to purple. These colors are determined by the altitude of the particles and the types of gases they are colliding with in the Earth's atmosphere.
