# Markdown Format: A Quick Guide

In this document, we will explore the basics of markdown format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted documents using plain text. It's widely used for creating documents, writing blog posts, and even generating web pages.

## Headers

Headers are an essential component of markdown. 

### Subheadings

You can create different levels of headings by using the '#' symbol. For example:

```
# First Heading
## Second Heading
### Third Heading
```

## Emphasis and Styling

Markdown allows you to apply various styles to your text. You can make text **bold**, *italic*, or even ~~strikethrough~~.

## Lists

Lists are a great way to organize information in markdown. There are two types of lists: ordered and unordered.

### Unordered Lists

You can create unordered lists by using the '-' symbol. For example:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, simply use numbers:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links and Images

Markdown allows you to create links to websites and embed images easily.

### Links

You can create a [link to a website](https://www.example.com) by using the following syntax:

```
[link text](https://www.example.com)
```

### Images

To insert an image, use the following syntax:

```
![alt text](image-url)
```

## Quotes and Code Blocks

Markdown also allows you to include quotes and code blocks.

### Quotes

> This is a quote. You can attribute it to someone or leave it as is.

### Code Blocks

You can format code by using backticks. For inline code, use single backticks (`). For a code block, use triple backticks (```):

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
