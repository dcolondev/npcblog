## A Brief History
Coffee's origins can be traced back to ancient Ethiopia, where it was first discovered. It then spread to the Arabian Peninsula, where coffee cultivation and trade flourished. From there, coffee made its way to Europe, and eventually across the globe. Today, coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide.
