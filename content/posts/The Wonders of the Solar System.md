3. Earth – our home planet with a diameter of 7,917.5 miles
4. Mars – known as the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance
5. Jupiter – the largest planet with a diameter of 86,881 miles
6. Saturn – known for its extraordinary rings made of ice and debris
7. Uranus – known for its extreme tilt, causing its seasons to last 20 years each
8. Neptune – the farthest planet from the Sun, with winds of up to 1300 miles per hour
