Walking into a forest is like entering a different realm. The tall, majestic trees create a canopy overhead, allowing only slivers of sunlight to shine through. The air is filled with the scent of fresh earth and the melodious songs of birds. The tranquility of the forest provides an escape from the noise and chaos of the modern world.
