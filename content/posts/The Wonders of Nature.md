Home to a myriad of marine life, it stretches over 2,300 kilometers and is visible from space. Snorkeling or diving in its crystal-clear waters is like entering a vibrant underwater paradise.

## 3. The Amazon Rainforest

As the largest tropical rainforest on the planet, the Amazon rainforest is a treasure trove of biodiversity. With its rich ecosystem and unparalleled beauty, it provides a habitat for countless species of plants and animals. Exploring its depths will leave you in awe of nature's intricate web of life.

## 4. Niagara Falls
