Coffee, the beloved beverage that fuels our mornings and warms our hearts. Whether you're a casual sipper or a devout enthusiast, the world of coffee offers endless delights and surprises.

## Types of Coffee

### 1. Espresso
Espresso, known for its rich and intense flavor, is the foundation of many beloved coffee-based beverages such as cappuccinos and lattes. Its preparation involves forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans, resulting in a concentrated shot.

### 2. Arabica
Arabica, often considered the "superior" coffee bean, accounts for the majority of coffee production worldwide. It is known for its delicate flavors, low acidity, and aromatic qualities. Arabica beans thrive in higher altitudes and produce a well-balanced, smoother cup of coffee.

### 3. Robusta
Robusta, as the name implies, is a hardy coffee bean variety that is resistant to diseases and pests. It packs a stronger punch with higher caffeine content and a more intense and bitter taste compared to Arabica. Robusta beans are commonly used in espresso blends to add depth and crema.

## Coffee Brewing Methods

There are various ways to brew coffee, each resulting in a unique taste experience.

1. **Pour Over**: Pouring hot water over coffee grounds in a filter, allowing the water to slowly extract the flavors.

2. **French Press**: Immersing coffee grounds in hot water and pressing a mesh filter down to separate the grounds from the brewed coffee.

3. **Espresso Machine**: Using pressure to force hot water through finely ground coffee, extracting a small, concentrated shot.
