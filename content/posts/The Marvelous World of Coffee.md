Coffee, a beloved beverage enjoyed by millions of people worldwide. Whether you prefer it black or with a splash of cream, the rich aroma and delightful taste make it an essential part of many people's daily routine.

## Origins and History

Coffee cultivation can be traced back to ancient Ethiopia, where legend tells of a goat herder named Kaldi. One day, he noticed his goats became energetic after consuming certain berries. Intrigued, Kaldi tried the berries himself and experienced a newfound sense of alertness. Thus, the journey of coffee began.

During the 15th century, coffee spread across the Arabian Peninsula and soon after, the first coffeehouses emerged, becoming social and intellectual hubs. From there, coffee became a global phenomenon, with various brewing methods and unique flavors adopted by different cultures.

## Types of Coffee

1. **Espresso**: A concentrated form of coffee, brewed by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans. The base for many popular coffee beverages.

2. **Cappuccino**: Equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. Often topped with a sprinkle of cocoa or cinnamon.

3. **Latte**: A smooth and creamy coffee drink made with espresso and a generous amount of steamed milk.

4. **Americano**: A simple yet satisfying blend of espresso and hot water.

## Coffee Love Around the World
