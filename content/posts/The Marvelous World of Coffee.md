## Coffee Brewing Methods

The art of brewing coffee has evolved over time, giving rise to various methods. Some popular techniques include:

1. **Pour Over**: Also known as manual drip brewing, this method involves pouring hot water over coffee grounds in a filter setup, allowing the brewed coffee to drip into a container.
2. **French Press**: Coarse coffee grounds steep in hot water, and after a few minutes, a plunger is pressed down to separate the liquid from the grounds.
3. **Espresso**: High-pressure water is forced through finely ground coffee, resulting in a concentrated and flavor-packed shot.
4. **Cold Brew**: Coffee grounds are steeped in cold water for an extended period, producing a smooth, low-acid brew that can be enjoyed cold or hot.
