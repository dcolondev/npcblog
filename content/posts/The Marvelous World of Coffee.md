Coffee, the beloved beverage enjoyed by millions of people around the world, has a fascinating history and an even more delightful aroma and taste. It has become an integral part of our daily routine, providing a much-needed boost of energy and a moment of solace amidst the hustle and bustle of life. Whether you are a die-hard espresso lover or a fan of the classic drip brew, there is a coffee variety for everyone.

## Types of Coffee

1. **Espresso**: A concentrated form of coffee made by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans under high pressure. It forms the base for many popular coffee drinks, such as cappuccino and latte.
2. **Cappuccino**: A combination of equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. It is often topped with a sprinkle of cocoa or cinnamon for an added touch of flavor.
3. **Latte**: A creamy and smooth coffee beverage made with espresso and a large amount of steamed milk. It is typically topped with a thin layer of milk foam.
4. **Americano**: A diluted version of espresso, made by adding hot water to the espresso shot. It has a milder taste compared to other coffee varieties.
5. **Drip Brew**: The most common method of brewing coffee, where hot water drips through a filter containing ground coffee beans. It produces a flavorful and aromatic cup of coffee.
