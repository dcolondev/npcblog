## Origins of Coffee

Legend has it that coffee was discovered by an Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi. He noticed that his goats became exceptionally energetic after nibbling on certain berries. Kaldi tried the berries himself and experienced a burst of energy. Thus, the discovery of coffee was made!

The art of brewing coffee has evolved over centuries, resulting in a wide range of brewing methods. Some popular techniques include:

1. Espresso: Produces a concentrated shot of coffee by forcing pressurized hot water through finely ground coffee beans.
2. Pour-over: Involves pouring hot water over a filter containing coffee grounds, allowing the brewed coffee to drip into a container below.
3. French press: Achieves a full-bodied flavor by steeping coffee grounds in hot water, which is then separated using a plunger.
