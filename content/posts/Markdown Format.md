# Markdown Format

---

**Introduction:**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write richly formatted documents using plain text. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the intention of making it easy to write and read using minimal syntax. Markdown can be used to create documents like this one, write blog posts, create documentation, and more. In this document, we will explore some of the basic tags and formatting options available in markdown.

**Headings:**

In markdown, you can create headings using the "#" symbol. The number of "#" symbols determines the level of the heading. For example:

## Level 2 Heading

### Level 3 Heading

---

**Emphasis:**

You can add emphasis to your text using various formatting options. Here are a few examples:

- *Italic text* - To make text italic, surround it with single or underscores (_) like `_Italic text_`.

- **Bold text** - To make text bold, surround it with double or asterisks (**) like `**Bold text**`.

- ***Bold and italic text*** - To make text bold and italic, surround it with triple asterisks (***).

---

**Lists:**

Lists are an essential part of any document. Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Here are a few examples:

- Unordered list item 1
- Unordered list item 2
    - Nested unordered list item 1
    - Nested unordered list item 2

1. Ordered list item 1
2. Ordered list item 2
    1. Nested ordered list item 1
    2. Nested ordered list item 2

**Code Blocks:**

When discussing code, it is important to format it properly. Markdown allows you to include code blocks using backticks. Here's an example:

```
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

---

**Links and Images:**

Markdown also supports adding links and images to your documents. Here's how you can do it:

- [Link to Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - To create a link, use the following syntax: `[Link Text](URL)`.

- ![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png) - To add an image, use the following syntax: `![Alt Text](Image URL)`.
