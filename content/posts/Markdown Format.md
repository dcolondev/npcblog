# Markdown Format

Markdown is a lightweight markup language widely used for creating formatted documents. It provides a simple and intuitive way to structure text with headings, lists, links, and more. In this document, we will explore various markdown tags and their usage to create visually appealing content.

## Headings

Headings are used to provide structure to the document. There are six levels of headings available in markdown, with `#` representing the highest level.

### Level 3 Heading

#### Level 4 Heading

## Lists

Lists can be used to organize information in a bullet or numbered format.

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

## Links

Links can be added to provide references or additional resources. They can link to external websites or other sections within the document.

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are useful for displaying code snippets or examples. They can be styled to support various programming languages.

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("John")
```

## Tables

Tables can be created by combining vertical bars `|` and hyphens `-`.

| Name     | Age | City      |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| John     | 25  | New York  |
| Emily    | 30  | London    |
| Michael  | 35  | Melbourne |
