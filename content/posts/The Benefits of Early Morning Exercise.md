# The Benefits of Early Morning Exercise

Are you a morning person? If not, it might be time to reconsider. Incorporating early morning exercise into your daily routine can have a plethora of benefits. 

Firstly, it can kickstart your metabolism for the day, which means you’ll burn more calories throughout the day, even when you’re not working out. It can also give you a boost of energy, making you feel more alert and ready to tackle the day ahead. 

Additionally, morning exercise can help regulate your sleep cycle, reducing the likelihood of insomnia or restless sleep. This is due to the release of serotonin and other hormones during exercise that promote feelings of relaxation and calmness. 

But perhaps the biggest benefit of early morning exercise is the boost it gives to your mental health. Exercise releases endorphins, which can help reduce stress and anxiety levels, as well as boost feelings of happiness and overall well-being. 

So, next time you hit snooze on your alarm clock, think about the benefits you could be missing out on. Set your alarm a little earlier than usual and give early morning exercise a try - your body and mind will thank you.
