*Astronomy* is the scientific study of celestial objects, such as stars, planets, and galaxies. It has fascinated humans for centuries, sparking curiosity about the universe we live in. By observing and analyzing the vast cosmos, astronomers have made remarkable discoveries that have expanded our understanding of the universe.

## The Birth of Stars

Stars are born inside massive clouds of gas and dust called *nebulae*. The force of gravity causes these nebulae to collapse, forming a *protostar*. Through a process known as *nuclear fusion*, the protostar ignites and begins to emit light.

## Exploring the Solar System

Our *solar system* is comprised of the Sun, eight planets, and numerous other celestial bodies. Each planet has unique characteristics, offering valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the universe. For instance, Mars, often referred to as the "red planet," possesses intriguing similarities to Earth, making it a prime target for future exploration.

### Key Facts about Mars

- Average distance from the Sun: 227.9 million km
- Diameter: 6,792 km
- Surface temperature range: -87 to -5 degrees Celsius
- Gravity: 0.38 times that of Earth

## Peering into the Universe

Astronomers use *telescopes* to observe distant objects in space. These powerful instruments capture and amplify light, enabling us to see celestial bodies that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. Over time, improvements in telescopic technology have revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos.

## The Expanding Universe

One of the most groundbreaking discoveries in astronomy is that the universe is constantly expanding. This revelation was made possible by American astronomer Edwin Hubble, who observed distant galaxies moving away from us. The theory of *cosmic inflation* suggests that the universe underwent a rapid expansion shortly after the Big Bang, setting the stage for its ongoing expansion.
