The Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, provide valuable insights into the geological history of the Red Planet. Similarly, the Hubble Space Telescope has given us breathtaking images of distant galaxies, expanding our understanding of the cosmos.

### The Future of Space Exploration

As technology advances, so do our aspirations in space exploration. Plans for manned missions to Mars, the establishment of lunar bases, and the search for extraterrestrial life are just a glimpse into the future.
