Legend has it that coffee was first discovered in Ethiopia by a goat herder named Kaldi. According to the tale, Kaldi noticed that his goats became particularly energetic and restless after consuming the berries of a certain plant. Intrigued, he tried the berries himself and experienced a similar invigorating effect. This marked the inception of coffee as we know it today!

## Journey to Arabia and Beyond

Coffee cultivation soon spread from Ethiopia to the Arabian Peninsula. By the 15th century, coffee had become a popular drink in the Arabian region, enjoyed for its stimulating properties. The rise of coffee coincided with the emergence of coffeehouses, which quickly became bustling social hubs where scholars, poets, and intellectuals gathered to discuss ideas over a steaming cuppa.

## Exploring the European Love Affair

In the early 17th century, coffee made its way to Europe, first arriving in Italy and then gaining popularity across the continent. Coffee's energizing effects were highly appreciated, particularly by those seeking a welcome alternative to alcoholic beverages. European coffeehouses emerged as vibrant centers of intellectual and artistic exchange, with the likes of Voltaire and Bach often finding inspiration within their walls.

## The Birth of Coffee Plantations

As the demand for coffee grew, European powers began establishing coffee plantations in their colonies. This led to the cultivation of coffee in various regions, such as the Americas, Africa, and the East Indies. The global coffee trade flourished, shaping economies and fostering cultural exchange between distant lands.

From the deliciously aromatic espresso of Italy to the meticulously brewed pour-over in specialty cafes, coffee preparation methods have evolved and diversified over time.
