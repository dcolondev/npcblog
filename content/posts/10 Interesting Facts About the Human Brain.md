# 10 Interesting Facts About the Human Brain

The human brain is one of the most complex and fascinating organs in the human body. Its intricate structure and function have been the subject of study for centuries. Here are 10 interesting facts about the human brain:

1. The human brain contains over 100 billion neurons, which are responsible for transmitting information between the brain and the rest of the body.

2. The brain uses approximately 20% of the body's energy, despite only accounting for 2% of the body's weight.

3. The largest part of the brain is the cerebrum, which is responsible for voluntary movement, sensory perception, and higher cognitive functions such as memory and problem-solving.

4. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, the left and the right, which are connected by a bundle of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum.

5. The human brain is capable of generating new neurons throughout life, a process called neurogenesis.

6. The brain's limbic system, which includes the amygdala and hippocampus, is responsible for emotions and memory.

7. The human brain is the only brain known to have a "default mode network," which is active when a person is not focused on the outside world.

8. The brain is capable of rewiring itself in response to new experiences or injuries, a phenomenon called neuroplasticity.

9. The prefrontal cortex, which is located at the front of the brain, is responsible for decision-making, planning, and self-control.

10. The brain produces different types of waves, including alpha, beta, and theta waves, which can be measured using an electroencephalogram (EEG).

In conclusion, the human brain is an incredibly complex and fascinating organ. Its structure and function have been studied for centuries, and yet there is still so much to learn.
