## Tools and Technologies

### Submarines

Submarines are specially designed vehicles that enable humans to explore the ocean depths. Equipped with advanced technology, they can withstand the extreme ocean pressures and safely transport scientists and researchers to uncharted territories.

### Sonar Systems

Sonar systems use sound waves to map the ocean floor and detect underwater objects. By analyzing the data collected, researchers can create detailed maps and identify potential areas of interest.

### Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs)

ROVs are unmanned submersible vehicles controlled remotely by operators on the surface. Equipped with cameras and various tools, ROVs can reach extreme depths and capture high-quality images and videos of underwater environments.
