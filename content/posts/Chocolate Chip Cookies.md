## Introduction

Chocolate chip cookies are a delicious and satisfying treat enjoyed by people of all ages. They are a classic favorite, combining the rich flavor of chocolate with the comforting taste of freshly baked cookies. Whether you enjoy them warm and gooey or crisp and crunchy, chocolate chip cookies always hit the spot.

## History

The origin of chocolate chip cookies can be traced back to Ruth Graves Wakefield, who is credited with inventing this delightful dessert. In the 1930s, while running the Toll House Inn in Massachusetts, Wakefield decided to add chopped chocolate to her cookie dough, hoping that it would melt and create an all-new cookie. Surprisingly, the chocolate bits retained their shape, and thus, the iconic chocolate chip cookie was born.

## Recipe

Here is a simple recipe for making delicious chocolate chip cookies:

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup brown sugar, packed
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups chocolate chips

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until well combined.
3. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined.
6. Stir in the chocolate chips.
7. Drop rounded tablespoons of the cookie dough onto a baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
8. Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.
9. Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Enjoy!

Now that you have the recipe, go ahead and bake a batch of these delicious chocolate chip cookies. They are perfect for sharing with family and friends, or simply enjoying as a sweet treat for yourself.

Remember, chocolate chip cookies are best when enjoyed fresh out of the oven, so don't forget to grab a glass of milk to complement the delightful flavors.
