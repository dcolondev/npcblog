- **Code Blocks:** Markdown provides a convenient way to display and highlight code snippets and blocks, making it ideal for programmers and technical writers.
- **Images:** Including images in your Markdown documents is as easy as providing a path or URL to the image file.
- **Tables:** Markdown supports the creation of tables, allowing you to present data in a clear and structured manner.
