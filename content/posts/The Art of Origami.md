Origami is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. It involves creating intricate designs and shapes by folding a single sheet of paper, without cutting or using any glue. The word "origami" comes from the Japanese words "ori" meaning folding, and "kami" meaning paper.

## History

Origami has been practiced in Japan for over 1,000 years. It was initially used for religious ceremonies, but gradually became an art form enjoyed by people of all ages. The Samurai warriors also practiced origami, as it required patience, concentration, and precision â€“ qualities essential for their training.

## Benefits

Origami offers numerous benefits beyond just being a creative pastime. It is a meditative practice that can help reduce stress and promote relaxation.
