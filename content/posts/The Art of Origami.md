Origami is the ancient Japanese art of paper folding. It involves turning a flat piece of paper into a three-dimensional sculpture through a series of intricate folding techniques. Origami has been practiced for centuries and is not only a form of artistic expression but also a medium for relaxation and mindfulness. 

## History of Origami

The exact origin of origami is unknown, but it is believed to have started in Japan around the 6th century AD. During that time, paper was scarce and costly, so origami was initially reserved for the privileged, including the nobility and religious ceremonies. As paper became more affordable, origami spread to different parts of the world, evolving into various styles and techniques.

## Basic Principles and Techniques

Origami begins with a square sheet of paper. Without cutting or gluing, the paper is folded and manipulated to create intricate designs. The beauty of origami lies in the simplicity of its toolsâ€”just paper and hands.

### Types of Folds

1. Valley Fold: Folding the paper inward along the crease.

2. Mountain Fold: Folding the paper outward along the crease.

3. Reverse Fold: Folding a part of the paper back onto itself.

4. Sink Fold: Tucking a portion of the paper inside, creating a layered effect.
