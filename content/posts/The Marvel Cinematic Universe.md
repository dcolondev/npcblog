# The Marvel Cinematic Universe

The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is a popular American media franchise created by Marvel Studios, originally based on characters that appear in Marvel Comics! The franchise has been a major cultural phenomenon since the release of the first Iron Man movie in 2008.

## Phase One

The first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe introduced us to the likes of Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. The Avengers, which was released in 2012, brought all these heroes together for the first time and was a massive success, cementing the franchise's place in pop culture.

## Phase Two

The second phase of the MCU saw the introduction of even more characters, including Ant-Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy. The phase also featured Avengers: Age of Ultron, which again saw all of the heroes come together in an attempt to save the world.

## Phase Three

The third phase of the MCU brought us to the Infinity Saga, a massive storyline that was planned out over a decade. With the introduction of characters like Black Panther and Doctor Strange, the MCU was able to further expand its universe. It all led up to the epic conclusion in Avengers: Endgame, which broke box office records and solidified the MCU's place as one of the biggest franchises in the world.

Now, with the start of Phase Four, we are set to see even more exciting stories and characters join the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
