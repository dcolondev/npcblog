The fourth phase began with Black Widow (2021) and is set to continue with several upcoming films and Disney+ series, including The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, Loki, and Hawkeye.

The MCU has become the highest-grossing film franchise of all time, with its films collectively grossing over $22 billion worldwide. It has also received critical acclaim and numerous awards and nominations, including three Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, as well as numerous other nominations across various categories.
