# Markdown Formatting: A Guide

Hey there! Are you new to using markdown? No worries, this guide will help you get up to speed with the basics. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to easily format text. It's commonly used for writing documentation, creating blog posts, or even just taking notes. Let's dive right in!

## Headers

Headers are created by using the pound sign (#) followed by a space. The number of pound signs determines the level of the header.

### Example

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

## Emphasis

You can use asterisks or underscores to create italic or bold text.

- *Italic*: Surround your text with a single asterisk (*) or underscore (_).
- **Bold**: Surround your text with double asterisks (**) or underscores (__).

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

Unordered lists can be created using asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens (-).

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered Lists

Ordered lists are created by using numbers followed by periods.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links and Images

You can add links to your markdown document easily.

To include an image, use the following format:

```
![Alt Text](image-url)
```

## Code Blocks

To display code snippets or blocks, use triple backticks or indent the text by four spaces.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
    
## Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be used to highlight text or quotes. Simply prefix the text with a greater-than (>) sign.

## Tables

Markdown allows you to create simple tables using pipes (|) and hyphens (-).

| Name  | Age |
|-------|-----|
| John  | 25  |
| Sarah | 30  |
| Mark  | 35  |
