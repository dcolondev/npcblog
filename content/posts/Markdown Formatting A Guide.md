# Markdown Formatting: A Guide

Markdown is a lightweight markup language widely used for creating content that can be easily converted into various formats, such as HTML, PDF, or even LaTeX. It offers a simple syntax that allows writers to focus on the content itself, without needing to worry about complex formatting. In this guide, we will explore some of the key features and formatting options available in Markdown.

## Headings

Headings are created by using one or more hash (#) symbols followed by a space and the heading text. The number of hash symbols determines the heading level. For example:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Unordered lists can be created using either asterisks (*), plus signs (+), or hyphens (-):

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered lists are created by using numbers followed by periods:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links

Links can be created with Markdown by using square brackets for the link text and parentheses for the URL:

[Markdown Guide](https://www.example.com)

## Images

Images can be inserted using a similar syntax to links, but with an exclamation mark (!) before the square brackets:

![Alt Text](/path/to/image.jpg)

## Emphasis

To emphasize text, you can use either asterisks (*) or underscores (_):

*italic*
**bold**
___both italic and bold___

## Code Blocks

To highlight code or display code blocks, you can use backticks (\`) for inline code or triple backticks for fenced code blocks:

`print("Hello, World!")`

```
def foo():
    return "bar"
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be created by using the greater-than symbol (>) before the text:

> This is a blockquote. It can span multiple lines and is commonly used for quoting text from other sources.
