# Markdown Formatting: A Guide

Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text documents. It provides a simple way to create structured documents without the need for complex formatting tools. In this guide, we will explore the basics of markdown formatting and how to use it effectively.

## Headers

Headers are used to organize content and provide hierarchy within a document. Markdown supports six levels of headings, denoted by the number of hash symbols (#) placed before the text. For example:

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

## Emphasis and Strong emphasis

Emphasis and strong emphasis allow you to highlight or emphasize certain parts of your text. Markdown provides two basic ways to achieve this:

- Wrap text in single asterisks (*) or underscores (_) to *italicize* it.
- Wrap text in double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__) to **bold** it.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullet point) lists. To create an ordered list, start each item with a number followed by a period. For unordered lists, use asterisks (*), plus signs (+), or hyphens (-) as bullets:

```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

## Links

Adding links to your document is straightforward. Surround the anchor text with square brackets [ ], followed immediately by the URL within parentheses ( ):

```

```

## Images

To add images, use the same format as links but with an exclamation mark (!) at the beginning:

```
![Alt Text](path_to_image.jpg)
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are useful for quoting text from external sources. Simply prefix each line with a greater-than sign (>) to create a blockquote.

## Code Blocks

To display code or command snippets, use backticks (\`). For code blocks spanning multiple lines, use triple backticks (```):

```
`code snippet`

```
multi-line
code snippet
```

## Horizontal Rules

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more hyphens (---), asterisks (***), or underscores (___) on a new line:

## Tables

Markdown also supports the creation of tables. Use the pipe symbol (|) to define cell boundaries and hyphens to separate the header row from the content:

```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Content 1| Content 2|
```

## Conclusion

Markdown is a user-friendly and versatile tool for document formatting. It provides a simple syntax for creating visually appealing content without the need for complex formatting tools. Hopefully, this guide has given you a good starting point for using markdown effectively.
