# Markdown Formatting: A Guide

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows writers to easily format text documents. It offers a simple and intuitive way to add formatting elements such as headers, lists, links, and more. This document will provide you with the essential knowledge to write and format content using markdown.

## Headers

Headers are used to structure your document and create hierarchical relationships. Markdown offers six levels of headers, which are denoted by the number of hash symbols (#) that precede the text.

### Example:

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

## Lists

Lists are a great way to present information in a concise and organized manner. Markdown supports ordered and unordered lists.

### Example:

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

- Item A
- Item B
- Item C
```

## Links

Markdown allows you to add hyperlinks to your documents. You can create both inline and reference links.

### Example:

```

## Images

In addition to links, you can also embed images in your markdown documents using a similar syntax.

### Example:

```
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

## Emphasis

Emphasis is a powerful tool to highlight specific words or phrases. Markdown offers several ways to add emphasis to your text, including **bold**, *italic*, and ~~strikethrough~~.

## Code Blocks

Markdown provides a way to display code snippets or entire blocks of code. You can specify the language for syntax highlighting, which enhances code readability.

### Example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

hello_world()
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to highlight and draw attention to quotes or excerpts from external sources.

### Example:

> "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." - Nelson Mandela
