If you're new to meditation, it can be intimidating to know how to get started. However, it's important to remember that meditation is a personal practice and there is no right or wrong way to do it. You can start with just a few minutes of meditation each day and gradually work your way up to longer sessions.

There are also countless resources available to help you get started, from guided meditation apps to meditation classes at your local gym or community center.
