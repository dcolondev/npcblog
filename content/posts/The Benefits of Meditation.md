## Physical Health Benefits

Meditation has been linked to numerous physical health benefits, such as lower blood pressure and reduced inflammation in the body. It can also boost the immune system and improve sleep quality.

## How to Meditate

To meditate, find a quiet and comfortable place to sit. Close your eyes and focus on your breath, taking slow and deliberate breaths in and out.
