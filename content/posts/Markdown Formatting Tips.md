# Markdown Formatting Tips

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write easily readable and structured documents. It is widely used for creating content on the web, including blog posts, documentation, and even to create static websites.

## Headings

You can define heading levels using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols represents the heading level.

### Heading Level 3
#### Heading Level 4
##### Heading Level 5

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

Unordered List:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered List:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text using asterisks or underscores.

*Italic text*

**Bold text**

## Links and Images

You can include links and images using the following syntax:

## Tables

Markdown also supports the creation of tables.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Item 1   | Item 2   | Item 3   |
| Item 4   | Item 5   | Item 6   |

## Code Blocks

You can highlight code using backticks or triple backticks for multi-line code blocks.

Inline `code` can be easily included.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be used to highlight quotes or information.
