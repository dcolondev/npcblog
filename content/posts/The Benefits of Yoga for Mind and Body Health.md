Practicing yoga regularly also improves focus, clarity, and concentration. It creates a sense of inner peace and tranquility, leading to improved mental well-being.

It helps to manage emotions effectively, reducing feelings of anger, irritability, and frustration. Yoga also promotes self-acceptance and self-love, fostering emotional stability and resilience.
