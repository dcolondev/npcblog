Coffee, the world's favorite caffeinated beverage, has an intriguing history and a remarkable variety of flavors. Whether you're a coffee connoisseur or a casual drinker, there's something for everyone to appreciate in the wonderful world of coffee.

## Background

Legend has it that coffee was first discovered in Ethiopia by a goat herder named Kaldi. One day, Kaldi noticed that his goats became energized after munching on some red berries. Curious, he decided to try them himself and experienced a similar effect. This serendipitous encounter eventually led to the spread of coffee cultivation and consumption across the globe.

## Types of Coffee

2. **Café Latte:** A combination of espresso and steamed milk, a café latte offers a creamy texture and a balanced flavor that appeals to many coffee lovers.

3. **Americano:** Made by diluting espresso with hot water, the Americano is a milder option that maintains the coffee's rich taste.

4. **Cappuccino:** Equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foamed milk, the cappuccino is often decorated with intricate latte art.

## Coffee Cultures Around the World
