# The Benefits of Outdoor Exercise

When it comes to exercising, many people immediately think of going to the gym or doing a workout video at home. However, there is a lot to be gained from exercising in the great outdoors. Here are a few benefits of outdoor exercise:

## Vitamin D

When you exercise outdoors, especially during the daytime, you expose your skin to natural sunlight, which allows your body to produce vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for strong bones and a healthy immune system.

## Fresh Air

Indoor exercise can often mean breathing in recycled air, which can be full of pollutants and allergens. Exercising outdoors allows you to breathe in fresh air, filling your lungs with oxygen and improving your overall well-being.

## Scenery

Being surrounded by nature while you exercise can be calming and therapeutic. From the beauty of a sunrise or sunset to the sights and sounds of wildlife, being outdoors can bring a pleasant distraction to your workout routine.

## Variety

Running on the treadmill or using the elliptical at the gym can quickly become monotonous. With outdoor exercise, you can change up your routine by hiking, biking, swimming, or participating in outdoor sports.

### Conclusion

Exercising outdoors provides several benefits that you can’t find indoors, including better access to vitamin D, fresh air, beautiful scenery, and exercise variety. So next time you’re thinking of hitting the gym, try taking your workout outside!
