# Markdown Formatting: A Visual Guide

In this document, we will explore the basics of markdown formatting. Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for creating structured documents. It allows you to easily format texts while keeping the focus on the content. Markdown is widely supported and can be converted into various other formats such as HTML.

## Headers

Headers are used to indicate the hierarchy and structure of the document. You can create headers by adding hash symbols before the text. The number of hash symbols determines the level of the header.

### Subheader

#### Sub-subheader

## Emphasis

You can emphasize words or phrases with different styles:

- *Italic*: Surround the text with single asterisks (*) or single underscores (_).
- **Bold**: Wrap the text with double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__).
- ***Bold and Italic***: Combine both styles by using triple asterisks or underscores.

## Lists

Markdown supports ordered and unordered lists. 

Unordered lists can be created using dashes, asterisks, or plus signs:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered lists are created using numbers:

1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item

## Links

Links can be created using the following syntax:

## Code Blocks

Code blocks can be created by indenting each line of code with four spaces, or by using a triple backtick (\```) before and after the code block.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to highlight or quote text. Simply prepend the text with a greater-than symbol (>).
