<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create documents with plain text formatting. It is widely used for creating documentation, writing articles, and even in applications like GitHub and Stack Overflow.

This guide will walk you through the different formatting options Markdown offers. Let's dive in!

<a name="headers"></a>
## Headers

Headers help create a hierarchy in your document. You can use up to six levels of headers, each represented by hash "#" symbols. For example:

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

<a name="emphasis"></a>
## Emphasis

Markdown provides options to emphasize or highlight specific parts of your text. Here are a few examples:

- *Italic text* is achieved by wrapping the text in a single asterisk or underscore.
- **Bold text** is achieved by wrapping the text in two asterisks or underscores.
- ***Bold and italic text*** is achieved by wrapping the text in three asterisks or underscores.
- ~~Strikethrough text~~ is achieved by wrapping the text in double tildes.

<a name="lists"></a>
## Lists

Lists are useful for organizing content in both ordered and unordered formats. Here's how you can create them:

### Ordered List
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered List
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

<a name="links"></a>
## Links

Hyperlinks are essential for referencing external resources or linking to other parts of your document.

Here's how to create a link:

<a name="images"></a>
## Images

You can also display images using Markdown.

Here's the syntax:

![Image Title](image-url.png)

<a name="code-blocks"></a>
## Code Blocks

Markdown allows you to display code snippets or blocks with proper formatting.

Here's an example of displaying code inline: `print("Hello, Markdown!")`

To create code blocks, use triple backticks followed by the programming language:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Markdown")
```

<a name="blockquotes"></a>
## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are useful for highlighting quotes or lengthy excerpts.

To create a block quote, prepend the ">" symbol before the text:

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs

<a name="tables"></a>
## Tables

Tables help present tabular data in an organized manner.

Here's an example:

| Name   | Age | Country |
|--------|-----|---------|
| John   | 25  | USA     |
| Lisa   | 28  | Canada  |
| Maria  | 31  | Brazil  |
