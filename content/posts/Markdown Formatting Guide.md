# Markdown Formatting Guide

In this markdown formatted document, we will explore various tags and formatting options available in markdown, which can be used to create visually appealing documents or webpages.

## Headings
Headings help in structuring and organizing your document. You can use `#` tags to create different levels of headings, like so:

### Heading Level 3
#### Heading Level 4
##### Heading Level 5

## Lists
Lists are essential when presenting information in a structured manner. Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. For unordered lists, you can use asterisks `*`, hyphens `-`, or plus signs `+`:

- Unordered List Item 1
- Unordered List Item 2
* Unordered List Item 3
+ Unordered List Item 4

For ordered lists, use the number followed by a period:

1. Ordered List Item 1
2. Ordered List Item 2
3. Ordered List Item 3

## Emphasis
Emphasis can be added to text using different tags. Surrounding a text with single asterisks `*` or underscores `_` will make it *italic*, while using double asterisks `**` or underscores `__` will make it **bold**.

## Links and Images
Markdown also supports adding links and images to your document. To create a link, use the following format:
[Link Text](https://www.example.com)

If you want to include an image, use the following format:
![Alt Text](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)

## Code Blocks
To highlight code or programming-related content, use code blocks. Surround the code with three backticks:
```python
def greeting(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
greeting("Markdown")
```

## Blockquotes
To include a blockquote, use the `>` symbol. It is often used for highlighting quotes or important information:
> "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken." - Oscar Wilde
