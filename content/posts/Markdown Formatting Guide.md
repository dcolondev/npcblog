# Markdown Formatting Guide

> *Disclaimer: This document was generated by an AI language model.*

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text in a simple and easy-to-read way. It allows you to add formatting elements to plain text, such as headers, lists, links, and images, without the need for complex and bloated formatting tools.

## Basic Syntax

### Headers

Headers are used to create titles and subtitles. They are denoted by hash symbols followed by a space, with each additional hash symbol representing a lower level of header.

Example:

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

### Text Formatting

You can make text **bold** by wrapping it in double asterisks or double underscores. To make it *italic*, use single asterisks or single underscores. For ~~strikethrough~~ text, use double tilde symbols.

Example:

```
**Bold Text**
*Italic Text*
~~Strikethrough Text~~
```

### Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists. To create an unordered list, use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens as bullet points. For ordered lists, use numbers followed by periods.

Example:

```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

### Links and Images

To create a link, use square brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL. To insert an image, use an exclamation mark before the link syntax.

Example:

```
[Google](https://www.google.com)

![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png)
```

## Advanced Features

### Code Blocks

Code blocks are used to display code snippets or examples. They can be created by indenting each line with four spaces or by using triple backticks.

Example:

```
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, World!")
```

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Tables

Tables can be created using the pipe character (`|`). The first row defines the table headers, and subsequent rows contain the table cells. Use colons within the header row to align columns.

Example:

```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
```

### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to highlight quoted text or information. They can be created by using the greater than symbol (`>`).

Example:

> This is a blockquote. It can span multiple lines and is commonly used for citing sources or emphasizing important information.

## Conclusion

Markdown is a versatile and user-friendly markup language that simplifies text formatting. Use this guide as a reference to create visually appealing and well-structured Markdown documents.
