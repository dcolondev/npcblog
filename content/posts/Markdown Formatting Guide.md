## 1. Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write documents with plain text formatting that can be easily converted into HTML or other rich text formats.

In this guide, we will cover the various aspects of markdown formatting, including headers, emphasis, links, lists, images, code blocks, blockquotes, and horizontal rules.

## 2. Headers

Headers are used to create titles or headings in your document. There are six levels of headers available, with `#` representing the highest level and `######` representing the lowest level.

```markdown
# Main Heading
## Subheading 1
### Subheading 2
#### Subheading 3
##### Subheading 4
###### Subheading 5
```

## 3. Emphasis

Emphasis can be added to your text using various markers.

- *Italic* text: Surround the text with single asterisks or underscores: `*text*` or `_text_`.
- **Bold** text: Surround the text with double asterisks or underscores: `**text**` or `__text__`.
- ***Bold and italic***: Surround the text with triple asterisks or underscores: `***text***` or `___text___`.

## 4. Links

Links can be added to your document using the following syntax:

```markdown
[Link Text](URL)
```

For example, [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) provides a comprehensive reference for markdown syntax.

## 5. Lists

Unordered lists can be created using either asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens:

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

Ordered lists can be created by numbering the items:

```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

Nested lists can also be created by indenting the items with four spaces or a tab.

## 6. Images

Images can be inserted into your document using the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt Text](URL)
```

For example:

![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png)

## 7. Code Blocks

Code blocks can be created using triple backticks: 

\```python  
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
\```

## 8. Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be used to highlight quoted content:

> "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken." - Oscar Wilde

## 9. Horizontal Rules

Horizontal rules can be added using three hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:
