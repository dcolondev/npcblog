# Markdown Formatting Guide

In this document, we will explore the key aspects of markdown formatting. Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to be easy to read and write. It allows you to format plain text into structured content that can be easily converted to HTML. Markdown is widely used for creating documentation, writing blog posts, and even as a formatting option on various platforms like GitHub and Reddit.

## Sections

Markdown uses different tags to create sections, headings, and subheadings. For example, to create a heading, use one or more hash symbols (#), followed by a space and the title text. The number of hash symbols determines the heading level. For instance:

## Subheading

### Sub-subheading

## Formatting Text

Markdown provides several options for formatting text. For instance, you can make text *italic* by enclosing it with single asterisks or underscores. Similarly, you can make it **bold** by using double asterisks or underscores. If you want to strike through text, use double tildes. Here's an example:

*Italic Text* \
**Bold Text** \
~~Strikethrough Text~~

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Unordered lists are created by using asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens. For ordered lists, use numbers followed by periods. Here are a few examples:

Unordered List:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered List:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

## Code Blocks

When including code snippets or blocks, it's important to format them appropriately. Markdown allows you to do so by enclosing the code in backticks (\`). You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting. For example:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

greet()
```

## Images

To include images in your markdown document, use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets with the alt text and the image URL in parentheses. Here's how to do it:

![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)

## Links

Links can be added to your markdown document using the format `[Link Text](URL)`. For instance, you can visit [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for more information.
