# Markdown Formatting Guide

Welcome to the Markdown Formatting Guide! Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write richly formatted documents using plain text. In this guide, we will cover the basics of Markdown syntax and show you how to create visually appealing and well-organized documents.

## Headers

Headers are created using the hashtag symbol (`#`). The number of hashtags determines the level of the header, with one hashtag for the largest header and six hashtags for the smallest.

### Formatting Text

You can format text in various ways, including **bold**, *italic*, and ~~strikethrough~~.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Unordered lists are created using hyphens (`-`), plus signs (`+`), or asterisks (`*`). Ordered lists are created using numbers followed by periods.

### Code Blocks

To display code or commands, use triple backticks (\```) to create a code block. You can specify the programming language after the opening backticks for syntax highlighting.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello_world()
```

## Links and Images

You can create links by enclosing the link text in square brackets, followed by the URL in parentheses. To add images, use a similar syntax, but with an exclamation mark (!) before the square brackets.

## Tables

Markdown allows you to create tables using hyphens (`-`) and pipes (`|`). The first row represents the table header, while subsequent rows create the table cells.

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

## Blockquotes

You can create blockquotes by using the greater than (`>`) symbol. Blockquotes are useful for highlighting important information or quoting external sources.
