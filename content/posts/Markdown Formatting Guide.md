# Markdown Formatting Guide

Welcome to this markdown formatting guide! In this guide, we will cover the basics of markdown syntax and showcase various tags to help you create visually appealing and well-structured documents.

## Headings

Headings are used to structure the content of your document. Markdown provides six levels of headings, with `#` being the highest level and `######` the lowest level. For example:

# Heading Level 1
## Heading Level 2
### Heading Level 3
#### Heading Level 4
##### Heading Level 5
###### Heading Level 6

## Text Formatting

Markdown allows you to format your text using various tags. Here are some commonly used ones:

- **Bold text**: Surround your text with double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`).
- *Italic text*: Surround your text with single asterisks (`*`) or single underscores (`_`).
- ~~Strikethrough text~~: Surround your text with double tilde symbols (`~~`).

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Here's an example of an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

And here's an example of an unordered list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

## Links and Images

## Code Blocks

Markdown allows you to display code snippets or blocks. For inline code, use backticks (\`), like this: `print("Hello, Markdown!")`. For code blocks, use triple backticks with the appropriate language specified, like this:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Markdown")
```

## Blockquotes

To add blockquotes to your document, use the `>` symbol. For example:

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted web documents.

## Conclusion

This guide covered some basic markdown syntax and highlighted various tags you can use to make your documents visually appealing. Experiment with different combinations to find your own style!
