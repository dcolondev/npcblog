# Markdown Formatting Guide

---

## Headings

Headings in Markdown are created by using one to six hashtags (`#`). The number of hashtags corresponds to the heading level.

For example:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

---

## Emphasis

To make text *italic*, use single asterisks or underscores (`*` or `_`) around the text.

To make text **bold**, use double asterisks or underscores (`**` or `__`) around the text.

To create a ~~strikethrough~~ effect, use double tildes (`~~`) around the text.

---

## Lists

### Ordered Lists

Ordered lists are created by using numbers followed by a period.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered Lists

Unordered lists can use either asterisks (`*`), plus signs (`+`), or hyphens (`-`).

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

## Links

To create a hyperlink, use square brackets for the link text followed by parentheses for the URL.

For example: [Markdown Formatting Guide](https://example.com/markdown-guide)

---

## Images

To include an image, use an exclamation mark (`!`) followed by square brackets for the alt text and parentheses for the image URL.

---

## Code Blocks

To create a code block, indent each line by four spaces or one tab.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

hello_world()
```

---

## Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, use a greater than sign (`>`).

> A blockquote is used to indicate quoted text or citations.

---

## Tables

To create tables, use hyphens (`-`) to create headers followed by pipes (`|`) to separate columns.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Content  | Content  | Content  |
| Content  | Content  | Content  |

---

## Footnotes

Footnotes can be created by using a caret (`^`) followed by the footnote text. At the bottom of the document, add the corresponding footnote definition.

Here is an example of a[^1] footnote.

[^1]: This is the footnote definition.
