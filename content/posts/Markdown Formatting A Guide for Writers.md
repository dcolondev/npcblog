# Markdown Formatting: A Guide for Writers

---

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows writers to create formatted documents with ease. It provides a simple syntax for styling text, adding headings, creating lists, and much more. In this guide, we will explore various markdown tags and learn how to create visually appealing documents.

## Headings

Headings in markdown are created using hash (#) symbols. The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading, with one being the highest level. For example:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

## Formatting Text

You can format text in markdown using various tags. Here are some examples:

- *Italic Text*: Use single asterisks or underscores around the text.
- **Bold Text**: Use double asterisks or underscores around the text.
- ~~Strikethrough Text~~: Use double tildes around the text.
- `Inline Code`: Use backticks around the text.
- > Blockquote: Use a greater than symbol at the beginning of the line.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Here's how to create them:

### Ordered List
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

### Unordered List
- Item A
- Item B
- Item C

## Links and Images

You can add links and images to your markdown documents using the following syntax:

## Code Blocks

To include code blocks, indent each line by four spaces or use triple backticks. Specify the language to enable syntax highlighting.

```python
def greeting(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greeting("Markdown")
```

## Tables

Markdown also supports the creation of tables. Here's an example:

| Name  | Age |
|-------|-----|
| John  | 25  |
| Sarah | 30  |
