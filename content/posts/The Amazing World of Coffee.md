## Origins of Coffee

Legend has it that the discovery of coffee dates back to ancient times. According to popular belief, a goat herder in Ethiopia noticed his goats becoming increasingly energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. Curious, he decided to try the berries for himself, and thus coffee was born.
