# Markdown Crash Course

In this markdown crash course, we will cover the basics of markdown syntax and how you can use it to format your documents. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to style text on the web. It is widely used for writing documentation, creating README files, and even writing blog posts.

## Headers

You can create headers by using hash symbols (#). The number of hash symbols indicates the level of the header. For example, a main header can be created with one hash symbol while a subheader can be created with two hash symbols.

## Emphasis

To emphasize certain words or phrases, you can use asterisks or underscores. For *italics*, use a single asterisk or underscore, and for **bold**, use double asterisks or underscores.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. To create an unordered list, simply use a hyphen or an asterisk at the beginning of each item. For an ordered list, use numbers followed by a period.

- Item 1
- Item 2
    - Subitem 1
    - Subitem 2

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links and Images

You can create links by enclosing the link text in square brackets and the actual link in parentheses. For images, it's similar, just add an exclamation mark at the start.

This is a [link](https://www.example.com/) and this is an ![image](https://www.example.com/image.png).

## Code Blocks

To display code blocks, use backticks. You can either use single backticks for inline code or triple backticks to create a code block.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Blockquotes

To create blockquotes, use the greater-than symbol at the beginning of each line.

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

## Tables

Tables can be created by using pipes and hyphens. The first line consists of the header and the second line contains hyphens to separate the header from the content.

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
