In this document, we will explore the various reasons why sleep is crucial and how it affects different aspects of our lives.

## Physical Health

Adequate sleep plays a significant role in maintaining our physical health. During sleep, our bodies repair and rejuvenate themselves.

## Productivity and Performance

Getting sufficient sleep positively influences our productivity and performance levels. When we are well-rested, we experience:
