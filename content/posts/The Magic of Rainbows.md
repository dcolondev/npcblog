## Introduction

Rainbows are one of nature's most enchanting phenomena. They grace the sky with their vibrant colors, captivating our imaginations and filling us with a sense of wonder. In this document, we will explore the captivating world of rainbows and understand the science behind their magical appearance.

## How are Rainbows Formed?

Rainbows are formed when sunlight interacts with water droplets in the air. When sunlight enters a raindrop, it undergoes refraction, which causes the light to bend as it moves from one medium (air) to another (water). The light then reflects off the inside surface of the raindrop and exits, creating a beautiful display of colors.

## The Colors of a Rainbow

The colors of a rainbow, in order, are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. This sequence of colors is often remembered using the acronym "ROYGBIV."

## Double Rainbows

Occasionally, you might be lucky enough to witness a double rainbow. Double rainbows are formed when light undergoes an additional reflection inside the raindrop, creating a secondary arc above the primary rainbow. The colors of the secondary rainbow are reversed compared to the primary rainbow.

## Conclusion

Rainbows are truly magnificent spectacles of nature. They remind us of the beauty and harmony that exist in the world around us. The next time you spot a rainbow, take a moment to appreciate its magic and let it fill your heart with joy.
