Yoga is known to reduce stress, improve flexibility, and strengthen the body. Additionally, it has been proven to help people with chronic conditions such as arthritis, depression, and anxiety. 

There are many different types of yoga, each with its own unique benefits. Some types of yoga are more physically challenging, while others are more focused on relaxation and meditation.
