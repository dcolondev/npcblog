## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used to format plain text. With its simple syntax, it allows writers to create well-structured documents with minimal effort. This guide will introduce you to some of the basic and advanced features of Markdown.

## Basics

### Headers

Headers are used to structure sections within a document. Markdown supports six different levels of headers, denoted by the number of hash (#) symbols used before the text.

Example:

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

### Emphasis

To add emphasis to your text, Markdown provides several options:

- *Italics* can be generated using a single asterisk (*) or underscore (_) before and after the text.
- **Bold** text can be created by using double asterisks (**) or underscores (__).
- You can also combine the two for ***bold italics***.

### Links

Adding links is straightforward in Markdown. To create a hyperlink, use the following format:

```
[Link Text](URL)
```

Example:

```
[Learn Markdown](https://www.example.com)
```

### Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

Unordered lists can be created using asterisks (*) or dashes (-):

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

Ordered lists are generated using numbers:

```
1. First Item
2. Second Item
3. Third Item
```

## Advanced Formatting

### Images

To insert images into a Markdown document, use the following syntax:

```
![Alt Text](URL)
```

You can also resize the image:

```
![Alt Text](URL =WIDTHxHEIGHT)
```

### Tables

Tables can be created in Markdown using hyphens (-) and pipes (|) to define the columns and rows:

```
| Column 1            | Column 2       |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Row 1, Column 1     | Row 1, Column 2|
| Row 2, Column 1     | Row 2, Column 2|
```

### Code Blocks

Code blocks can be displayed in Markdown using triple backticks (```) before and after the code. Specify the language for syntax highlighting.

Example:

\```python

print("Hello, World!")

\```

## Conclusion

Markdown language offers a simple and efficient way to format text documents. By using the syntax and features discussed in this guide, you can create visually appealing documents effortlessly.
