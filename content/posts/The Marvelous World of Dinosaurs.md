Dinosaurs, those magnificent creatures that once roamed the Earth, continue to captivate our imaginations. From the towering Tyrannosaurus rex to the gentle Brachiosaurus, these prehistoric beings have left an indelible mark on our planet's history.

## Dinosaur Classification

Dinosaurs are categorized into two main groups:

1. Saurischia - These dinosaurs have a lizard-like hip structure, and include the meat-eating theropods and the herbivorous sauropodomorphs.
2. Ornithischia - Dinosaurs in this group have a bird-like hip structure, and this group comprises various plant-eating dinosaurs such as the Stegosaurus and Triceratops.

## Mesozoic Era: The Age of Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which is divided into three periods:

- Triassic Period: This period marked the dawn of the dinosaurs, with creatures such as the Coelophysis appearing.
- Jurassic Period: The Jurassic period saw the rise of the famous dinosaurs like the Brachiosaurus and the Allosaurus.
- Cretaceous Period: This period witnessed the emergence of the Tyrannosaurus rex and the Triceratops, among others.

## Discovery and Study

Many scientists and paleontologists have dedicated their lives to the discovery and study of dinosaurs. Through fossilization and excavation, these experts have uncovered a wealth of information about these ancient creatures. Museums around the world showcase dinosaur skeletons and provide interactive displays to educate and inspire people of all ages.

## The End of the Dinosaurs

Approximately 66 million years ago, a catastrophic event, likely an asteroid impact, led to the extinction of most dinosaurs. However, avian dinosaurs survived and evolved into the diverse bird species present today.
