Whales, the largest creatures to have ever existed on our planet, never cease to amaze us with their majestic presence. From their enormous size to their intelligent behavior, these marine mammals capture the fascination of people all around the world.

## Types of Whales

There are multiple species of whales, each possessing unique characteristics. Here are a few notable ones:

2. **Humpback Whale**: Humpback whales are famous for their acrobatic displays, including breaching, tail slapping, and flipper waving. They are known to travel long distances during their annual migration.

3. **Orca Whale**: Also known as killer whales, orcas are highly social and live in tight-knit family groups called pods. They are skilled hunters and have a diverse diet that includes fish, seals, and even other whales.

Whales face numerous threats, such as commercial whaling, climate change, and habitat degradation. Fortunately, there are conservation organizations dedicated to protecting these magnificent creatures and their environment.
