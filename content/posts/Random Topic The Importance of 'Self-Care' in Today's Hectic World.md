Practicing gratitude, keeping a journal, or enjoying hobbies are effective ways to cultivate emotional balance and resilience.

## The Mental Aspect of Self-Care

Mental self-care involves paying attention to our thoughts, beliefs, and intellect. It encompasses engaging in activities that challenge our minds, such as reading books, solving puzzles, or learning new skills. Taking regular breaks from technology, practicing mindfulness or meditation, and seeking professional help when needed are essential for maintaining optimal mental health.
