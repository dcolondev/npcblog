## Fiction

### 1. *To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee

"Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."

Set in the Deep South during the 1930s, this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel explores themes of racism, injustice, and morality through the eyes of Scout Finch, a young girl growing up in a small town.

### 2. *1984* by George Orwell

"Big Brother is watching you."

Orwell's dystopian masterpiece depicts a totalitarian society ruled by a surveillance state. It serves as a chilling warning about the dangers of unchecked government control and the erosion of individual freedoms.

## Non-Fiction

### 1. *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* by Yuval Noah Harari

"History began when humans invented gods, and will end when humans become gods."

In this thought-provoking book, Harari takes us on an intellectual journey through the history of our species, exploring topics such as biology, culture, and the rise of civilizations. It challenges our basic beliefs about humanity and provides a fresh perspective on the human story.

## Conclusion

These are just a few of the books that have left a lasting impact on me. I encourage you to explore these titles and discover the magic they hold within their pages.

Happy reading!
