# The Wonderful World of Chess

Chess is one of the most popular board games worldwide. It is played on a square board divided into 64 squares of alternating colors. The game requires strategic thinking, concentration, and careful planning.

## Rules of Chess

- Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
- The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the king is in a position to be captured with no legal move to escape.
- Each piece moves in a unique way. The king can move one square in any direction, the queen moves diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, and the rook moves horizontally or vertically.
- Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. They move forward one square but capture diagonally.
