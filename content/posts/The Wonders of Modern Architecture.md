Designed by Danish architect JÃ¸rn Utzon, this iconic structure is instantly recognizable with its distinctive sail-like roofs. The Sydney Opera House hosts various performing arts events and has become an emblematic landmark of Australia.

In the realm of civil engineering, the Millau Viaduct in France is a testament to architectural brilliance. This cable-stayed bridge, designed by British architect Norman Foster, spans the Tarn River Gorge, reaching a height of 343 meters. Its slender piers and transparent appearance blend harmoniously with the natural surroundings, creating a seamless integration of man-made and natural elements.
