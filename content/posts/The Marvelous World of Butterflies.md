Butterflies are enchanting creatures that captivate our imagination with their vibrant colors and delicate wings. These insects belong to the order Lepidoptera and are known for their remarkable transformation from crawling caterpillars to graceful butterflies. In this markdown document, we will explore some fascinating facts about butterflies.

## Life Cycle of a Butterfly

1. **Egg Stage**: A female butterfly lays eggs on leaves, usually on plants that caterpillars can feed on.
2. **Caterpillar Stage**: The egg hatches, giving rise to a caterpillar or larva. This stage is characterized by rapid growth as the caterpillar feeds on leaves.
3. **Pupa or Chrysalis Stage**: The caterpillar forms a chrysalis or pupa, inside which it undergoes metamorphosis.
4. **Adult Butterfly Stage**: Finally, the chrysalis breaks open, and a magnificent adult butterfly emerges with its vivid colors and intricate wing patterns.

## Butterfly Facts

- Butterflies are found on every continent except Antarctica.
- Some butterflies live for only a few days, while others can survive for months or even a year.
- The largest butterfly is the Queen Alexandra's Birdwing, with a wingspan of up to 12 inches.
- Butterflies taste with their feet, helping them identify potential host plants for laying eggs.
- They have long, coiled tongues called proboscis, which they use to sip nectar from flowers.
