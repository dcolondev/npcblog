## History of the Grand Canyon

The Grand Canyon's history dates back over 10,000 years, making it one of the oldest landscapes on Earth. The Native American people who reside in the region have been present for over 4,000 years, with the Havasupai, Hopi, Hualapai, and Navajo tribes still calling the Grand Canyon and its surrounding areas home. In 1919, the Grand Canyon was established as a U.S national park, becoming one of the country's greatest treasures.
