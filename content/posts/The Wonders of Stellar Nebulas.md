## Introduction
Stellar nebulas, also known as nebulae, are interstellar clouds of dust, hydrogen, helium, and other ionized gases. These fascinating celestial objects are a crucial part of the cosmos, as they serve as stellar nurseries, hosting the birth of new stars.

## Formation
Stellar nebulas form through the gravitational collapse of giant molecular clouds. As the cloud contracts, the conservation of angular momentum causes it to start spinning. The central part becomes a protostar, while the outer regions are left as a rotating disk of gas and dust.

## Classification
There are four main types of stellar nebulas:

* **Emission Nebulas**: These nebulas are formed by the emission of light from ionized gases. The iconic red shade of these nebulae is produced by excited hydrogen atoms.

* **Reflection Nebulas**: These nebulas scatter and reflect the light of nearby stars, creating a blue coloration. They lack the emission lines seen in emission nebulae.

* **Dark Nebulas**: Dark nebulas, as the name suggests, are opaque enigmatic clouds of gas and dust that block the light emitted by background stars.

* **Planetary Nebulas**: Planetary nebulae are shells of ejected material produced by stars in the late stages of their stellar evolution.

## Famous Stellar Nebulas
Here are some notable stellar nebulas:

1. **Orion Nebula**: Located in the Orion constellation, this emission nebula is one of the brightest and most easily recognizable nebulae from Earth.

2. **Eagle Nebula**: This famous emission nebula is known for its awe-inspiring Pillars of Creation, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.

3. **Crab Nebula**: The Crab Nebula, formed from a supernova explosion, is a remnant of a star that was observed by Chinese astronomers in 1054 A.D.

## Conclusion
Stellar nebulas are captivating celestial phenomena that continue to mesmerize astronomers and space enthusiasts alike. Their beauty and complexity remind us of the vastness and wonders of our universe.
