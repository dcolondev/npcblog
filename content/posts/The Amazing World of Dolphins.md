## Dolphin Species

There are nearly 40 species of dolphins, ranging from the popular bottlenose dolphins to the lesser-known Hector's dolphins. Each species has its unique characteristics and can be found in different parts of the world. Some species are well-adapted to freshwater environments, while others thrive in saltwater habitats.

Dolphins are known for their high level of intelligence. They possess remarkable problem-solving abilities and can learn complex tasks. They have showcased their intelligence in various ways, such as using tools, communicating through a sophisticated system of clicks and whistles, and even displaying self-awareness.
