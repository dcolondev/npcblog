# Markdown Formatting: A Guide to Style and Structure

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create beautifully formatted documents with ease. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced writer, mastering markdown can greatly enhance your writing skills. In this guide, we'll explore the various tags and techniques you can use to create visually appealing documents.

## Headers

Markdown provides several ways to create headers:

### Level 1 Header
To create a level 1 header, simply prepend the text with a hash (#) symbol.

### Level 2 Header
A level 2 header is created by using two hash symbols (##).

### Level 3 Header
To create a level 3 header, use three hash symbols (###).

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis to your text using different markdown tags:

- *Italic text* can be created by surrounding the text with a single asterisk or underscore.
- **Bold text** is achieved by enclosing the text with double asterisks or underscores.
- ***Bold and italic text*** can be created by combining the two tags.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists:

### Unordered List
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 1
  - Sub-item 2

### Ordered List
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
