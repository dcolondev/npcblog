## History of Coffee

The history of coffee dates back centuries. Legend has it that coffee was discovered in Ethiopia by a goat herder named Kaldi. He noticed that his goats became energetic after eating certain berries from a particular tree. Intrigued, he tried the berries himself and experienced increased alertness. Later, the knowledge of coffee spread to the Arabian peninsula, leading to the first coffee houses.
