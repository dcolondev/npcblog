# The Science of Rainbows

Rainbows are one of the most beautiful meteorological phenomena that we can observe in nature. A rainbow is created when light is refracted, reflected and dispersed through a combination of water droplets and sunlight.

## How are Rainbows formed

Rainbows are formed when light enters a water droplet, slows down, refracts (or bends) and disperses into a spectrum of colors. The light then reflects off the inner surface of the water droplet and exits, producing a circular rainbow that we can see.

## The colors of the Rainbow

The colors of the rainbow are seven in number, and they are always present in the same order; Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet. The colors are arranged in this order because each color has a different wavelength, and they refract differently in the water droplets, causing the different colors to separate.

## Other types of Rainbows

In addition to the traditional circular rainbow, there are other types of rainbows that are less common. These include the twinned rainbow, the supernumerary rainbow, and the reflection rainbow.
