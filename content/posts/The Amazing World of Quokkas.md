## Introduction
Quokkas are small marsupials native to Australia. They are known for their friendly and curious nature, making them one of the most beloved animals in the world.

## Appearance
Quokkas are about the size of a domestic cat, with a round face, a short snout, and small rounded ears. They have a compact body covered in coarse fur, which ranges in color from gray to brown. The most striking feature of a quokka is their perpetually smiling face, earning them the title of "the happiest animal on earth."

## Habitat
Quokkas predominantly inhabit the southwestern part of Western Australia, particularly on Rottnest Island and Bald Island. They prefer dense vegetation, such as shrublands and forests, where they can find shelter and ample food.

## Behavior
Quokkas are known for their friendly and sociable behavior. They are not afraid of humans and are often seen approaching visitors, making them a popular attraction for tourists. However, it's important to remember that they are wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.

## Conservation
Due to habitat destruction, predation by introduced species, and disease, quokka populations have declined significantly over the years. As a result, they are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Conservation efforts and strict regulations are in place to protect the remaining quokka populations.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, quokkas are truly remarkable creatures. Their unique appearance, friendly nature, and their captivating smile make them an iconic symbol of Australia's incredible wildlife.
