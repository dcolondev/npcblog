The universe is an astonishing place, filled with countless wonders waiting to be explored. From celestial bodies like stars and galaxies to cosmic phenomena such as black holes and supernovas, it never fails to captivate our imagination.

## Stars: The Sparkling Gems of the Universe

Stars are the luminous objects that fill our night sky. They are born from the remnants of exploded supernovas and continue to shine through the process of nuclear fusion at their cores. Stars come in various sizes, colors, and temperatures, showcasing the incredible diversity within our universe.

### Types of Stars

1. **Main Sequence Stars**: These are the most common type of stars, including our very own Sun. They burn hydrogen at their cores and release massive amounts of energy.

2. **Red Giants**: After a star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it expands and becomes a red giant. These stars are much larger and cooler than main sequence stars.

3. **White Dwarfs**: When a red giant runs out of fuel, it collapses under its own gravity and becomes a white dwarf. These compact objects are incredibly dense and emit a faint glow.

## Black Holes: The Enigmas of the Universe

Black holes are one of the most mysterious phenomena in the universe. They are regions in space where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape their grasp. Their formation occurs when a massive star collapses under its own gravity during a supernova.

### Facts About Black Holes

- Black holes have a boundary called the event horizon, beyond which nothing can return.
- They come in different sizes, ranging from stellar black holes to supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies.
- Black holes can distort time and space, causing a phenomenon known as gravitational time dilation.
