The universe is an endless expanse of wonders, filled with mystery and beauty. From the mesmerizing galaxies to the enigmatic black holes, every corner of the universe beckons us to explore and unravel its secrets.

## Galaxies: Celestial Marvels

Galaxies are the building blocks of the universe, composed of billions or even trillions of stars, gas, and dust. These majestic cosmic structures come in various shapes and sizes, ranging from spiral galaxies like our Milky Way to the elliptical and irregular ones.

### The Milky Way

Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is a remarkable sight to behold. It spans across approximately 100,000 light-years and is home to billions of stars, including our very own Sun. On a clear night, away from light pollution, gazing at the Milky Way can transport us to a world of cosmic grandeur.

Black holes, often referred to as the darkest entities in the universe, continue to captivate scientists and astronomers. These massive objects possess such immense gravitational pull that not even light can escape their grasp.

**Did you know?** Black holes come in different sizes. Stellar black holes are formed from the remnants of collapsed massive stars, while supermassive black holes reside at the centers of galaxies, containing millions or even billions of times the mass of our Sun.
