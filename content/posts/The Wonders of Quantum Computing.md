## Introduction

Quantum computing is a fascinating field that combines principles from physics, mathematics, and computer science. With the potential to revolutionize the way we process information, quantum computing has captured the imagination of researchers and scientists worldwide.

## How Does it Work?

Quantum computers leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computations. Unlike classical computers that rely on bits, quantum computers utilize qubits, allowing for parallel processing and exponentially faster calculations. This paradigm shift opens doors to solving complex problems that were previously intractable.
