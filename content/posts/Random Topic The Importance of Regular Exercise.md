Regular exercise is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It offers a wide range of benefits for both physical and mental well-being. In this document, we will explore some of the key reasons why regular exercise should be a part of everyone's routine.

## Physical Health Benefits

Regular exercise has numerous advantages for our physical health, including:

## Mental Well-being Benefits

Apart from its physical advantages, regular exercise has a significant impact on our mental well-being:
