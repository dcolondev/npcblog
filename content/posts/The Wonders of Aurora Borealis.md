### Canada
Canada's vast wilderness makes it an excellent destination to witness the Northern Lights. Locations like Whitehorse in Yukon and Yellowknife in Northwest Territories offer excellent visibility and opportunities to photograph the spectacle.

## Tips for Viewing the Northern Lights

- Choose a dark location away from city lights.
- Check the local weather forecast for clear skies.
- Dress warmly and bring hot beverages.
- Be patient, as the lights can appear and disappear unexpectedly.
