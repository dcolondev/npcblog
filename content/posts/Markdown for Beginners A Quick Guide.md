# Markdown for Beginners: A Quick Guide

Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for creating formatted documents. It provides a simple and intuitive way to format text without the need for complex coding. This guide aims to help beginners understand the basics of markdown and get started with creating beautifully formatted documents.

## Headers

Headers are used to create titles and headings in your document. You can create headers using the "#" symbol, followed by a space and the header text. Markdown supports six levels of headers, with "#" for the largest and "######" for the smallest.

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis to your text using various markdown tags. For *italics*, simply wrap the text in single asterisks or underscores. To make text **bold**, use double asterisks or underscores. ***Combining*** them creates text that is both bold and italicized.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. To create an unordered list, start each item with a dash or asterisk. To create an ordered list, simply start each item with a number followed by a period. Indentation can be used for nested lists.

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links

Adding links to your markdown document is straightforward. To create a hyperlink, use square brackets for the link text, followed by parentheses with the URL. For example, [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) will create a link to the Markdown Guide website.

## Images

In addition to links, you can also add images to your markdown document. Use an exclamation mark, followed by square brackets for the alt text, and parentheses with the image URL.

## Code

Markdown allows you to display code snippets within your document. To create inline code, wrap the code with backticks (``). For larger code blocks, indent each line with four spaces or use triple backticks to create a fenced code block.

Inline code: `console.log('Hello, World!')`

Fenced code block:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

These are just the basics of markdown, but they should be enough to get you started. With a little practice, you can create well-structured and visually appealing documents using markdown.
