## Introduction

What lies beyond our solar system has always fascinated humanity. One of the most intriguing areas of exploration is the study of exoplanets, planets that orbit stars outside our own solar system. In this document, we will dive into the wonders of exoplanets and explore the latest discoveries.

### What is an Exoplanet?

An exoplanet, also known as an extrasolar planet, is a planet that does not orbit our Sun but orbits a different star within a different stellar system. These planets are located outside our solar system and have different characteristics, making them captivating subjects for scientific research.

## Discoveries and Research

### Methods of Detection

Scientists have employed various methods to detect exoplanets:

1. **Radial Velocity Method**: By observing the slight wobble of a star caused by an exoplanet's gravitational pull, scientists can infer the presence of an exoplanet around the star.

2. **Transit Method**: When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star, it causes a minor decrease in the star's brightness. This dip in brightness can be used to detect and study exoplanets.

3. **Direct Imaging**: Extraordinarily challenging due to the immense distance, direct imaging involves capturing the light of an exoplanet directly, separate from its star.

### Notable Exoplanet Discoveries

Some notable exoplanet discoveries include:

- **51 Pegasi b**: Discovered in 1995, it was the first confirmed exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star (main-sequence star).

- **Kepler-22b**: Announced in 2011, this exoplanet was the first planet found in the habitable zone of a star similar to our Sun.

- **TRAPPIST-1 System**: This remarkable system discovered in 2016 contains seven Earth-sized planets, with three of them orbiting within the habitable zone.

## Conclusion

Studying exoplanets offers a glimpse into the vastness and beauty of the universe. With advancing technology and the dedication of scientists around the globe, new exoplanets will continue to be discovered, unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos.
