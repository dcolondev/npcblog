## History of Coffee

The origins of coffee can be traced back to the Ethiopian plateau, where the coffee plant, Coffea, is believed to have been first cultivated. Legend has it that a shepherd discovered the stimulating effects of coffee when he noticed his goats becoming energetic after eating coffee berries. From there, the knowledge of coffee spread to other parts of Africa, as well as the Middle East and Europe.
