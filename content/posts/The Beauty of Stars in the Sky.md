### Constellations

One of the most fascinating aspects of stars are the constellations. These are groups of stars that appear to form a recognizable pattern when viewed from Earth. There are 88 officially recognized constellations, but many cultures have created their own based on their beliefs and myths.

The light from stars is truly fascinating. Many people believe that starlight has special powers and can influence our lives. But from a scientific standpoint, starlight is made up of electromagnetic radiation that travels across the universe at the speed of light.
