# The Benefits of Exercise for Mental Health 

Physical exercise is not only beneficial to our physical health but it can also contribute significantly to our mental health. Exercise has proven to have therapeutic effects on individuals who face anxiety and depression. Physical activity is believed to affect the brain and improve mood, focus, and mental clarity. 

One explanation for how exercise benefits our mental health is that exercise can trigger the release of endorphins in the body, which are our natural stress-relievers that enhance feelings of pleasure and happiness. Exercise can also reduce levels of cortisol in the body. Cortisol is the hormone responsible for feelings of stress and anxiety, so a reduction in cortisol levels can lead to a decrease in these negative emotions. 

In addition, exercise can improve self-esteem, confidence, and a sense of accomplishment for individuals who engage in it. Positive body changes and the ability to set and reach exercise goals can provide a sense of pride and self-worth, which can ultimately lead to improved mental health. 

Overall, physical exercise should be seen in a more positive light as a means to maintain good physical and mental health. So, put on your sneakers and take a walk, go for a run, or find an activity you enjoy and just move!
