## What is Caffeine?

Caffeine is a natural stimulant belonging to the class of compounds called xanthines. It acts as a central nervous system stimulant, improving mental alertness and physical performance. Caffeine is most commonly found in coffee beans, tea leaves, cocoa beans, and kola nuts.

## Effects of Caffeine on the Body

- **Enhances Physical Performance**: Caffeine has been shown to improve endurance and reduce perceived exertion during exercise.
- **Improves Focus and Concentration**: By increasing the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine, caffeine can sharpen focus and concentration.
- **May Aid Weight Loss**: Caffeine can slightly increase metabolism, which may help in burning calories and fat.
- **Can Cause Sleep Disturbances**: Consuming caffeine close to bedtime can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to insomnia.

## Recommended Caffeine Intake

While caffeine can provide benefits, it is important to consume it in moderation. The recommended caffeine intake for most healthy adults is around 400 milligrams per day, which is equivalent to about four cups of coffee. However, individual responses to caffeine may vary, and it is essential to listen to your body and adjust your intake accordingly.
