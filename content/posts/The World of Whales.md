Welcome to the fascinating world of whales! These majestic creatures have captivated humans for centuries with their immense size, extraordinary intelligence, and enigmatic behaviors. Whether you are a marine enthusiast or simply curious, this markdown document will give you a glimpse into the wonderful realm of these gentle giants.

## Types of Whales

Whales come in various shapes and sizes. Here are some of the most commonly known types:

- **Blue whale**: The largest animal on Earth, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet.
- **Orca (Killer whale)**: Known for their striking black and white coloring, killer whales are highly social and incredibly intelligent.
- **Humpback whale**: Recognizable by their long pectoral fins and mesmerizing songs, humpbacks are famous for their acrobatic displays.
- **Minke whale**: Despite being one of the smallest whale species, the minke whale is still impressive and has a widespread distribution.

## Migration Patterns

A remarkable feature of whales is their annual migration. These incredible journeys sometimes cover thousands of miles, as whales move between feeding and breeding grounds. For instance, the gray whale undertakes a migration of over 10,000 miles from the Arctic to warmer waters around Mexico.

## Threats and Conservation

Sadly, whales face numerous threats such as climate change, habitat degradation, pollution, and whaling. However, there is hope. Several organizations are actively involved in whale conservation, conducting research, and advocating for the protection of these magnificent creatures.
