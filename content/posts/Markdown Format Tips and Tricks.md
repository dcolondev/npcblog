# Markdown Format Tips and Tricks

Welcome to the markdown format tips and tricks guide. In this document, we will explore various tags and techniques to create visually appealing markdown documents.

## Headers

You can use headers to create sections and sub-sections in your document. There are six levels of headers, denoted by the number of "#" symbols at the beginning of the line.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Emphasis and Highlighting

You can use different formatting styles to emphasize or highlight specific words or phrases in your text.

- *Italics*: Use single asterisks or underscores.
- **Bold**: Use double asterisks or underscores.
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Use double tildes.

## Links and Images

You can easily insert links and images into your markdown documents.
