The mesmerizing natural phenomenon known as the Aurora Borealis, or the Northern Lights, has captivated people for centuries. These dancing lights that illuminate the night sky are a display of immense beauty and wonder. Let's delve into the enchanting world of auroras and discover the magic behind these breathtaking celestial spectacles.

## What Causes Auroras?

Auroras occur when charged particles from the sun's solar winds collide with atoms and molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. The Earth's magnetic field directs these particles towards the polar regions, where they interact with gases such as oxygen and nitrogen. The collision excites the atoms, causing them to release energy in the form of colored light, resulting in stunning displays of colorful curtains, arcs, and swirls across the sky.
