# Markdown Formatting Tips and Tricks

*Markdown* is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create richly formatted documents with ease. In this guide, we will explore some useful tips and tricks to make your Markdown documents visually appealing.

## Headers

Headers are a great way to structure your document and create hierarchy. You can use hash symbols to define different header levels, like so:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

## Emphasis and Styling

Emphasizing text allows you to draw attention to important points. You can use asterisks or underscores to achieve different effects:

*Italic text* can be created by surrounding the text with a single asterisk or underscore.
**Bold text** can be achieved by enclosing the text with two asterisks or underscores.
***Bold and italic text*** can be created by enclosing the text with three asterisks or underscores.

## Lists

Lists enable you to organize information in a structured manner. There are two types of lists in Markdown: ordered and unordered.

### Unordered lists 

You can create unordered lists using asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered lists 

To create ordered lists, simply prepend the items with numbers:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Code Blocks

When you want to display code, you can use backticks to create inline code or triple backticks to create a code block:

`console.log("Hello, World!");`

```
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## Links

Links are a fundamental part of any web document. You can create clickable links by enclosing the text in square brackets and providing the URL in parentheses:

To display images in your document, use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for alt text and parentheses with the image URL:
