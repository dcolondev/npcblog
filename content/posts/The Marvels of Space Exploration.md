Here, we delve into some remarkable aspects of space exploration that have paved the way for profound scientific discoveries.

## The Hubble Space Telescope

The **Hubble Space Telescope**, launched in 1990, has revolutionized our understanding of the universe. Orbiting beyond the distortion of Earth's atmosphere, it captures breathtaking images of distant galaxies, nebulae, and other celestial wonders. The Hubble has immensely contributed to our knowledge of the cosmos, uncovering mysteries such as the existence of dark matter and dark energy.

## Mission to Mars

The **Mars exploration missions**, like the *Curiosity rover* and the *Perseverance rover*, have shed light on the Red Planet's past habitability. These missions have revealed compelling evidence of water on Mars, increasing the possibility of past and perhaps even present life on our neighboring planet. The pursuit of sending astronauts to Mars is now becoming a reality, promising exciting new discoveries and expanding human presence into the unknown.

### Lunar Exploration

Moon and **lunar exploration** have been vital milestones in our quest to explore the universe. NASA's Apollo missions in the 1960s and 70s left an indelible mark by landing humans on the lunar surface. Recently, plans for returning to the Moon have been rejuvenated, paving the way for scientific research, lunar colonization, and launching platforms for future deep-space missions.
