# Markdown: A Guide to Formatting Text

This document will guide you through some basics of Markdown, a lightweight markup language used to format text. Markdown offers a simple and intuitive way to create structured documents. Whether you're writing a blog post, creating documentation, or even taking notes, Markdown can make your text more visually appealing and easier to read.

## Headers

You can create headers by prefixing the text with the "#" symbol. The number of "#" symbols will determine the header level.

## Emphasis

Emphasizing text is easy in Markdown. You can use asterisks (*) or underscores (_) to *italicize* or **bold** text. For example, `*italicize*` becomes *italicize* and `**bold**` becomes **bold**.

## Lists

Markdown also supports both ordered and unordered lists. To create a bullet list, simply use a "- " (hyphen and space) before each item. To create a numbered list, use "1. ", "2. ", and so on.

- Unordered item 1
- Unordered item 2
- Unordered item 3

1. Ordered item 1
2. Ordered item 2
3. Ordered item 3

## Links

Adding links is straightforward. You can create an inline link by wrapping the linked text in square brackets [ ] and the URL in parentheses ( ). For example, `[Markdown website](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)` becomes [Markdown website](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Images

Markdown lets you embed images easily. You can use a similar syntax to adding links, with an exclamation mark (!) at the beginning. For example, `![Markdown logo](https://example.com/markdown-logo.png)` becomes ![Markdown logo](https://example.com/markdown-logo.png).

## Blockquotes

If you want to quote someone, you can use blockquotes. Simply prefix the text with a "> " (greater than symbol and space). For example:

> Markdown is a great way to format text. It's simple, efficient, and widely supported.

## Code

When mentioning code, you can use backticks (`) to highlight it. For a single word, surround it with backticks, like `code`. For multiline code blocks, use triple backticks (\`\`\`):

\`\`\`python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
\`\`\`

## Summary

Markdown is a versatile and widely supported markup language that allows you to quickly format text. With basic knowledge of its syntax, you can enhance the readability and visual appeal of your documents.
