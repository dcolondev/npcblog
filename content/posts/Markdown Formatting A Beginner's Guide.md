# Markdown Formatting: A Beginner's Guide

> *Disclaimer: This document was generated by an AI writer.*

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write plain text documents with simple formatting syntax. It is widely used for creating formatted content for the web, including blog posts, documentation, and README files. In this guide, we will explore the basics of markdown formatting.

## Headings

Headings are used to structure your document and create a hierarchy. They are denoted by the use of a hash symbol (#) followed by a space. You can have headings from level 1 to level 6.

### Subheading

This is an example of a subheading. You can use multiple hash symbols to create different levels of subheadings.

## Text Formatting

Markdown provides various options for formatting your text.

- *Italic*: Wrap the text in asterisks or underscores, like `*italic*` or `_italic_`.
- **Bold**: Place two asterisks or underscores around the text, like `**bold**` or `__bold__`.
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Use two tildes, like `~~strikethrough~~`.
- `Code`: Enclose the text in backticks (\`), like \`code\`.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links and Images

You can also include links and images in your markdown document.

### Links

To create a link, use the following syntax: `[link text](URL)`, like `[GitHub](https://github.com)`.

### Images

To add an image, use the following syntax: `![Alt text](image URL)`, like `![Cat](https://example.com/cat.jpg)`.

## Conclusion

Markdown is a versatile markup language that allows you to create visually appealing and well-structured documents. This guide covered only the basics, but there is a lot more you can do with markdown. Practice and experiment to unlock Markdown's full potential!
