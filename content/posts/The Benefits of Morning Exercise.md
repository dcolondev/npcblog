# The Benefits of Morning Exercise

Are you a morning person or a night owl? If you're not a morning person, you might want to reconsider hitting the snooze button and skip your afternoon or evening workout. Early morning exercises might just be the thing to supercharge your day.

Studies have shown that people who exercise in the morning tend to be more consistent with their workout routine. Also, morning exercise boosts your metabolism, meaning you'll burn more calories for the rest of the day. Another benefit of morning exercise is that it increases your energy levels, making you more alert and productive during the day.

But how to become an early bird when you're a night owl? Start with small adjustments to your sleeping patterns. Try going to bed 15 minutes earlier each night until you achieve your desired wake-up time. Set out your workout clothes and gear the night before, so you have no excuse to stay in bed.

Give morning exercise a chance, and see if it changes the quality of your day.
