Mount Everest, known as Sagarmatha in Nepali, is the tallest mountain in the world. Located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the mighty Himalayas, Everest towers high at an elevation of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level. 

## Geography and Climbing Routes

Mount Everest is situated in the Solu-Khumbu region of Nepal and the Tingri County of Tibet. The mountain is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage site "Sagarmatha National Park."

### Popular Climbing Routes

1. South Col Route: This is the most commonly used route to reach the summit from the Nepalese side. It was the route used by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay when they successfully climbed Everest for the first time in 1953.

2. North Everest Expedition: This is the primary mountaineering route from the northern side in Tibet. Many expeditions use this route, which approaches Everest from Rongbuk Glacier.

## Challenges and Risks

Climbing Mount Everest is a challenging endeavor that requires months of physical preparation and mental fortitude. The risks involved cannot be underestimated, as climbers face extreme weather conditions, altitude sickness, avalanches, and other hazards.

It is crucial for climbers to have proper acclimatization and be well-equipped with essential gear and supplies. Adequate training and experience are essential to mitigate the risks associated with climbing the world's highest peak.
